Changes in Great Lakes cargo and hull losses, and shipping rates from Chicago to Buffalo, provide evidence of the value of storm warnings on the Great Lakes. Nearly half of the Great Lakes storm-warning stations were closed during the fall of 1883 because of appropriations reductions. This exogenous shock permits the econometric estimation of the value of storm-warning locations on the Great Lakes. The results indicate that the social rate of return for weather expenditures during the Weather Bureau's founding period was at least 60 percent.",Erik D. Craft,Erik D. Craft,,,,,,,,1

Initially, railroads and industrial firms were tightly controlled by a few shareholders; this situation was altered in the 1890's by massive mergers and reorganizations, which allowed private banks to control railroads and industrial firms. Between 1912 and 1939, bank control faded away as a result of a political reaction against financial institutions. Using stock-market data from 1914, I show that the eviction of banks from corporate boards depressed firm values by about 7 percent, and that part of this value came from cartelization.",Miguel Cantillo Simon,Miguel Cantillo Simon,,,,,,,,1

Household surveys taken before and after the transition indicate that overall wage inequality nearly doubled from 1991 to 1994 and has reached a level higher than that in the United States. Returns to both measured skills (education, occupation) and unmeasured skills within groups have increased considerably. Skill premiums across experience groups, however, have become more compressed and relative wages of older workers have declined. In addition, female wages have declined relative to male wages across all percentiles of the wage distribution.",Elizabeth Brainerd,Elizabeth Brainerd,,,,,,,,1

We estimate hazard functions and find that 40 to 50 percent of the difference in unemployment durations between the two republics is accounted for by differences in demographics and demand conditions. The remainder is explained by differences in coefficients, proxying the behavior of firms, individuals, and institutions. In both republics the unemployment compensation system has a moderately negative effect on the exit rate from unemployment. Policy makers hence have latitude in providing adequate social safety nets without jeopardizing efficiency.","John C. Ham, Jan Svejnar and Katherine Terrell",John C.

Since interest groups cannot enforce fee-for-service contracts with legislators, legislators have an incentive to create specialized, standing committees which foster repeated dealing between interests and committee members. The resulting reputational equilibrium supports high contributions and high legislative effort for the interests. Contribution patterns by competing interests in the congressional battle over whether banks can enter new businesses support the theory, which also has implications for term limits and campaign reform.",Randall S.

This paper explores the implications of such informational externalities for entry dynamics in the presence of multiple potential entrants. The nature of the entry game can be one of either waiting or pre-emption depending on the degree of patent protection.

Furthermore, strengthening intellectual property rights is not necessarily desirable for the patentee. The analysis may also help explain the apparently puzzling practice of delaying patent suits.",Jay Pil Choi,Jay Pil Choi,,,,,,,,1

Firms that announce layoffs in the previous year pay their CEOs more, and give their CEOs larger percentage raises than firms which do not have at least one layoff announcement in the previous year. However, the likelihood of announcing a layoff varies dramatically along other dimensions, for example firm size, which are also correlated with CEO pay. Once firm-specific fixed effects are controlled for, the CEO pay premium for laying off workers disappears. In addition, there is a small negative share price reaction to layoff announcements.",Kevin F. Hallock,Kevin F. Hallock,,,,,,,,1

When traders have private information on only a single dimension of uncertainty (the effect of a shock to the asset value), price adjustments prevent herd behavior. Herding arises when there are two dimensions of uncertainty (the existence and effect of a shock), but it need not distort prices because the market discounts the informativeness of trades during herding. With a third dimension of uncertainty (the quality of traders' information), herd behavior can lead to a significant, short-run mispricing.",Christopher Avery and Peter Zemsky,Christopher Avery,Peter Zemsky,,,,,,,1

Controlling for labor-market participation explains part, but not all, of this dip.

Our results suggest that court-ordered finance reform reduced within-state inequality in spending by 19 to 34 percent. Successful litigation reduced inequality by raising spending in the poorest districts while leaving spending in the richest districts unchanged, thereby increasing aggregate spending on education. Reform led states to fund additional spending through higher state taxes.","Sheila E. Murray, William N. Evans and Robert M. Schwab",Sheila E. Murray,William N. Evans,Robert M. Schwab,,,,,,1

The presence of adverse selection creates an indeterminacy of equilibrium. Many equilibria display permanent fluctuations characterized by transitions between Walrasian regimes and regimes of credit rationing. Cyclical contractions involve declines in real interest rates, increases in credit rationing, and withdrawals of savings from banks. For some configurations of parameters all equilibria display cyclical fluctuations. We provide sufficient conditions for deterministic cycles consisting of m periods of expansion followed by n periods of contraction to exist.",Costas Azariadis and Bruce Smith,Costas Azariadis,Bruce Smith,,,,,,,1

This paper shows that stock market liquidity and banking development both positively predict growth, capital accumulation, and productivity improvements when entered together in regressions, even after controlling for economic and political factors. The results are consistent with the views that financial markets provide important services for growth, and that stock markets provide different services from banks. The paper also finds that stock market size, volatility, and international integration are not robustly linked with growth, and that none of the financial indicators is closely associated with private saving rates.",Ross Levine and Sara Zervos,Ross Levine,Sara Zervos,,,,,,,1

Specifically, we ask whether industrial sectors that are relatively more in need of external finance develop disproportionately faster in countries with more-developed financial markets. We find this to be true in a large sample of countries over the 1980's. We show this result is unlikely to be driven by omitted variables, outliers, or reverse causality.",Raghuram G.

This unique equilibrium depends not only on the fundamentals, but also on financial variables, such as the quantity of hot money in circulation and the costs of speculative trading. In contrast to multiple equilibrium models, our model allows analysis of policy proposals directed at curtailing currency attacks.",Stephen Morris and Hyun Song Shin,Stephen Morris,Hyun Song Shin,,,,,,,1

This paper quantifies the effect of prior exporting experience on the decisions of Colombian manufacturing plants to participate in foreign markets. It develops a dynamic discrete-choice model of exporting behavior that separates the roles of profit heterogeneity and sunk entry costs in explaining plants' exporting status. Sunk costs are found to be significant, and prior export experience is shown to increase the probability of exporting by as much as 60 percentage points.",Mark J. Roberts and James R. Tybout,Mark J.

A model of adverse selection based on information advantages for private owners demonstrates how privatization can improve the quality and number of western managers in eastern enterprises. These benefits can increase with the size of the transition. Evidence of management replacement and significant differences between state-owned and privatized firms from a survey of eastern German firms supports model assumptions and predictions. These results suggest the importance of management replacement to successful privatization.,I. J. Alexander Dyck,I. J. Alexander Dyck,,,,,,,,1

The ""American"" system involves competitive bidding on each contract, large orders, and inspections. The ""Japanese"" system involves repeat purchases from a supplier who earns a premium, small orders, and no inspections. Both systems may coexist as local solutions, but the global optimum is determined by the ratio of set-up to inspection costs. This suggests that the adoption of flexible manufacturing equipment and rising product complexity may be responsible for the shift from the American to the Japanese system observed in many industries.",Curtis R.

We compare minimum resale price maintenance (RPM) to retail market-clearing in a model with a monopolistic manufacturer selling to competitive retailers. In both the RPM and flexible-price games, retailers must order inventories before the realization of demand uncertainty. We find that manufacturer profits and equilibrium inventories are higher under RPM than under market-clearing. Surprisingly, consumer surplus can also be higher, in which case unfettered retail competition can legitimately be called ""destructive.""","Raymond Deneckere, Howard P.

Strategic behavior by firms tends to reduce output, R&D, and welfare and so justifies higher subsidies except when R&D spillovers are low and firms' actions are strategic substitutes. It also reduces the benefits of R&D cooperation. Moreover, policies to encourage cooperation are likely to be redundant (since it is always privately profitable) and simulations suggest that the welfare cost of lax competition policy is high.",Dermot Leahy and J.

Such behavior is seen frequently in auctions, yet would be suboptimal within most existing models. Here, the seller uses resale to signal information about the object's value that could not easily be communicated via a reserve price announcement. The model predicts that bids for reauctioned objects increase relative to initial bids and that, on average, prices of both reauctioned items and those sold at initial auction rise as delay in reauctioning increases.",Ignatius J.

An owner of a property with a high loan-to-value ratio sets a higher asking price, has a higher expected time on the market and, if he sells, receives a higher price than an owner with proportionately less debt. The down payment requirement for purchasers, but not incumbent owners, provides a simple explanation for this phenomenon among owner-occupants.

Increases in the size of police forces are shown to be disproportionately concentrated in mayoral and gubernatorial election years.

In periods of major technological inventions, a decline in the relative importance of initial conditions raises inequality, enhances mobility, and generates a larger concentration of high-ability individuals in technologically advanced sectors, stimulating future technological progress and growth. However, once technologies become more accessible, mobility is diminished and inequality decreases but becomes more persistent. The reduction in the concentration of ability in technologically advanced sectors diminishes the likelihood of technological break-throughs and slows future growth.

This paper evaluates quantitatively the economic effects of the different policies used to finance these two wars. Counterfactual experiments are used to explore the implications of financing World War II like the Korean War, and financing the Korean War like World War II.

These indexes are utility-consistent and independent of arbitrary reference price vectors. We establish bounds on the dispersion of true multilateral indexes, hence bounds on convergence. International price indexes understate both true GDP dispersion and, where prices are converging over time, the rate of true quantity convergence.",Steve Dowrick and John Quiggin,Steve Dowrick,John Quiggin,,,,,,,1

These errors induce fluctuations in bank reserves which have measurable consequences for the federal funds rate.

Unlike variance-bounds tests, this facilitates an excess volatility test that does not rely on strong assumptions about discount rates or dividend streams. Although largely idiosyncratic, 15 percent of the average fund's excess risk is explained by market risk, small-firm risk, and risk that affects other closed-end funds.",Jeffrey Pontiff,Jeffrey Pontiff,,,,,,,,1

While growth rates of labor and capital income are not highly correlated within countries, we find that the returns to human capital and physical capital are very highly correlated within four OECD countries.

We develop a model with asymmetric information between countries that helps rationalize all the above observations and then examine the implications of this model for optimal domestic tax policy. Without asymmetric information, past work showed that small open economies should not impose corporate income taxes.

A model emphasizing differences in firm innovative capabilities and the importance of firm size in appropriating the returns from innovation is developed to explain the regularities. The model also explains regularities regarding the relationship within industries between firm size and firm innovative effort, innovative productivity, cost, and profitability. It predicts that over time firms devote more effort to process innovation but the number of firms and the rate and diversity of product innovation eventually wither.",Steven Klepper,Steven Klepper,,,,,,,,1

Agents interact through local public goods or externalities (school funding, neighborhood effects) and economy-wide linkages (complementary skills, knowledge spillovers). Sorting families into homogeneous communities often minimizes the costs of existing heterogeneity, but mixing reduces heterogeneity faster. Integration therefore tends to slow down growth in the short run yet raise it in the long run. A move to state funding of education presents society with a similar intertemporal trade-off. Local and global complementaries play major roles in determining the efficient social and educational structures.",Roland Bénabou,Roland Bénabou,,,,,,,,1

Both models lead to a relation between county employment density and productivity at the state level. Using data on gross state output we find that a doubling of employment density increases average labor productivity by around 6 percent. More than half of the variance of output per worker across states can be explained by differences in the density of economic activity.,Antonio Ciccone and Robert E. Hall,Antonio Ciccone,Robert E.

The model is estimated using exchange rates and data based upon observed central-bank interventions.

A government averse to redistribution retains a passive stake in the firm; the willingness to bear residual risk signals commitment. When a large government stake conflicts with the transfer of control, underpricing may be necessary for separation.

Voters are assumed to make comparisons between jurisdictions to overcome political agency problems. This forces incumbents into a (yardstick) competition in which they care about what other incumbents are doing. We provide a theoretical framework and empirical evidence using U.S. state data from 1960 to 1988. The results are encouraging to the view that vote-seeking and tax-setting are tied together through the nexus of yardstick competition.",Timothy Besley and Anne Case,Timothy Besley,Anne Case,,,,,,,1

The framework is one in which there are rich altruists and risk-averse poor who face some possibility of loss. The government represents the rich and makes transfers on their behalf. With unconditional transfers the poor may forgo insurance and rely on private charity to bail them out in the event of loss. This reliance on private charity has adverse efficiency effects. These may be avoided if the government makes in-kind transfers of insurance.,Stephen Coate,Stephen Coate,,,,,,,,1

It shows that a population will resist invasion by dominant mutant genes if individuals maximize a ""semi-Kantian"" utility function in games with their siblings. It is shown that a population that resists invasion by dominant mutants may be invaded by recessive mutants.

Unlike their illegal counterparts, legal cartels have published regulations and broader enforcement capabilities. However, differences in costs and size among cartel members still make quota selection contentious. Conflicts over quotas are typically resolved by voting. Side-payments to influence votes are prohibited. We examine the predicted effects of this real-world voting institution on prices and welfare. We also deduce the economic consequences of exogenous political changes such as alterations in the voting weights or in the identity of the voters.",Jonathan Cave and Stephen W.

However, open-economy versions of the theory predict higher rates of convergence than those observed empirically. We show that the open-economy model conforms with the evidence if an economy can borrow to finance only a portion of its capital, for example, if human capital must be financed by domestic savings.","Robert J.

This paper integrates these processes into a coherent framework for thinking about economic history. Pre-industrial development is driven by increasing returns to specialization made possible by a growing population. Increasing specialization eventually activates a learning technology and initiates industrial growth, which carries the economy to a fully market-based balanced-growth path. Among other things, we attribute a role to population and market size that is consistent with the evidence.",Marvin Goodfriend and John McDermott,Marvin Goodfriend,John McDermott,,,,,,,1

This paper provides an equilibrium account of the transition between barter and fiat-money regimes. The explanation relies on the intervention of a self-interested government which must be able to promise credibly to limit the issue of money. To achieve credibility, the government must offset the benefits of seigniorage by internalizing some of the macroeconomic externalities generated by the issue of fiat money. The government's patience and the extent of its involvement in the economy are key determinants of whether the transition can be accomplished.",Joseph A. Ritter,Joseph A. Ritter,,,,,,,,1

We show that once the participation decision is endogenized, market properties change dramatically. First, limited market participation can amplify the effect of liquidity trading relative to full participation; under certain circumstances, an arbitrarily small aggregate liquidity shock can cause significant price volatility. Second, there exist multiple equilibria with very different participation regimes and levels of asset-price volatility. Third, under plausible conditions the equilibria can be Pareto-ranked; the Pareto-preferred equilibrium is characterized by greater participation and lower volatility.",Franklin Allen and Douglas Gale,Franklin Allen,Douglas Gale,,,,,,,1

Standard-setters maximize their conception of social welfare, knowing that utility-maximizing students choose whether to meet the standard.

Optimal standards do not necessarily fall with increased student preference for leisure, deterioration of nonstudent inputs to education, or increased student heterogeneity.

Since the long-run price elasticity of demand is almost twice as large as the short-run price elasticity, the long-run increase in tax revenue from an increase in the federal excise tax on cigarettes is considerably smaller than the short-run increase.","Gary S.

Furthermore, in a market economy the latter must equal the MRS in exchange.

Perhaps surprisingly, pre-election communication may be counterproductive.

However, increased economic activity increases opportunities to profit from unethical behavior, eroding ethical standards over the long run.

This paper investigates three possible explanations. The first explanation is that shocks to the economy have been smaller in the postwar period. The second explanation is that the composition of output has shifted from very cyclical sectors to less cyclical sectors. The third explanation is that the apparent stabilization is largely spurious and is caused by differences in the way that prewar and postwar business-cycle reference dates were chosen by the NBER.

While the effects of inflation on growth are small, the effects of growth on the monetary system are substantial. The results are consistent with ideas about money and growth contained in work that predates that of Tobin and Sidrauski, as well as with evidence that money and asset demands vary systematically within economies as they develop.",Peter N.

We find that U.S. productivity growth is slightly higher than average, all of which is due to technical change.

We document the same properties in a two-country stochastic growth model in which trade fluctuations reflect, in large part, the dynamics of capital formation. We find that our general-equilibrium perspective is essential: the relation between the trade balance and the terms of trade depends critically on the source of fluctuations.","David K.

The model is specified so that, without private information, only high-quality commodities are produced, and there is no welfare gain from using money. With private information, there can be equilibria (and sometimes multiple equilibria) where low-quality commodities are produced, and money can increase welfare. Money works by promoting useful production and exchange. In efficient monetary equilibria, agents adopt strategies that increase the probability of acquiring high-quality output.",Steve Williamson and Randall Wright,Steve Williamson,Randall Wright,,,,,,,1

This inference follows from two widely held beliefs: sectoral shocks induce only positive unemployment--vacancy comovements, while negative comovements are necessarily the result of aggregate demand shocks. This paper describes an equilibrium matching model that identifies plausible circumstances in which neither assumption is correct, thus suggesting that unemployment--vacancy data are inconclusive. Interestingly, this model's novel results are due to standard features in the contracting literature: firms experience relative price shocks and negotiate contracts that prescribe temporary layoffs.",Arthur J.

A ""soft budget constraint"" problem arises when the state bank is unable to make a credible commitment not to refinance bad projects once some investment costs are sunk. In such a situation, if a consumer good is also demanded by firms as an input and the seller cannot separate firms from households, the high market-clearing price would lead to welfare losses because too many bad projects would start and crowd out household consumption.",Yingyi Qian,Yingyi Qian,,,,,,,,1

The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how to incorporate new product varieties into a constant-elasticity-of-substitution aggregate of import prices. This method is applied to U.S. imports of six disaggregate manufactured goods. It is shown that the corrected indexes are able to account for part--but not all--of the high income elasticities.,Robert C. Feenstra,Robert C. Feenstra,,,,,,,,1

As a criterion for distributive justice, I require that if both agents work equal numbers of hours, they should divide the output equally. I also require that the labor-supply decision should remain sovereign.

The inventor can protect his or her intellectual property by negotiating a contingent contract (with a buyer) prior to revealing the invention or, alternatively, the inventor can reveal the invention and then negotiate with the newly informed buyer. Despite the risk of expropriation, we find that, in equilibrium, an inventor with little wealth can expect to appropriate a sizable share of the market value of the invention by adopting the latter approach.",James J.

Efficient commitment, however, would require complete contracts. We study instead bilateral contracting, without commitment regarding others' terms. Each firm then fears that the supplier might opportunistically renegotiate another's contract to increase bilateral profit at the firm's expense. We show that nondiscrimination clauses generally cannot curb such third-party opportunism, even with symmetric firms. To reassure firms, crude forms of commitment may be adopted. This could explain the pervasiveness of exclusivity arrangements and the striking uniformity and intertemporal rigidity of franchise contracts.",R. Preston McAfee and Marius Schwartz,R.

In contrast to well-known results for market goods with close substitutes (i.e., candy bars and coffee mugs), our results indicate a convergence of WTP and WTA measures of value. However, for a nonmarket good with imperfect substitutes (i.e., reduced health risk), the divergence of WTP and WTA value measures is persistent, even with repeated market participation and full information on the nature of the good.","Jason F.

Our main findings are as follows: (i) permanent changes in government purchases can lead to short-run and long-run output multipliers that exceed 1; (ii) permanent changes in government purchases induce larger effects than temporary changes; (iii) the financing decision is quantitatively more important than the resource cost of changes in government purchases; and (iv) public investment has dramatic effects on private output and investment. These findings stem from important dynamic interactions of capital and labor absent in earlier equilibrium analyses of fiscal policy.,Marianne Baxter and Robert G. King,Marianne Baxter,Robert G.

Identification is achieved using only long-run restrictions, based on a theoretical model. The main results, are: (i) supply shocks, particularly country-specific ones, are very important in generating international business cycles, (ii) although the post-1973 flexible-exchange-rate period has been inherently more volatile, there are no differences in transmission properties of economic disturbances across exchange-rate regimes for the endogenous variables we focus on.","Shaghil Ahmed, Barry W.

The process of costly replacement and depreciation creates endogenous fluctuations in productivity, employment, and output of a single producer. We explore the spillover effects of machine replacement on other sectors of the economy and provide conditions for synchronized machine replacement by multiple independent producers. The implications of our model are generally consistent with observed monthly output, employment, and productivity fluctuations in automobile plants. Synchronization of retooling across plants within the auto industry is widespread, so that the fluctuations observed at the plant level have aggregate implications.",Russell Cooper and John Haltiwanger,Russell Cooper,John Haltiwanger,,,,,,,1

We begin by examining anecdotal evidence on the nature of the production control system in force during that period. Motivated by that evidence, we then extend the conventional linear-quadratic model of production behavior to take account of annual shutdown. Finally, we apply the modified model to newly available data on monthly unit production, sales, and inventories during 1924-1940. GM appears to have been aiming to maintain a targeted level of inventory relative to expected sales and, secondarily, to smooth production.",Anil K Kashyap and David W. Wilcox,Anil K Kashyap,David W.

This is puzzling, as it apparently implies a low degree of international capital mobility. This paper shows that the observed positive correlation between national saving and investment rates arises naturally within a quantitatively restricted equilibrium model with perfect mobility of financial and physical capital. The model is consistent with the fact that saving--investment correlations are larger for larger countries but are still substantial for small countries. Further, the model is consistent with the finding that current-account deficits tend to be associated with investment booms.",Marianne Baxter and Mario J. Crucini,Marianne Baxter,Mario J.

I show that a large debt was not an unconditional predictor of low investment in the 1980's, nor was investment abnormally low, when compared to a ""financial-autarky"" rate, calculated in the text. I do find, however, that the actual service of the debt crowded out investment. For the rescheduling countries I show that 1 percent of GDP paid abroad reduced domestic investment by 0.3 percent of GDP. This is identical to the correlation between investment and foreign finance observed in the 1960's.",Daniel Cohen,Daniel Cohen,,,,,,,,1

This paper investigates whether exchange-rate forecasts, although biased, are still rational. The idea is that investors can be rational and yet make repeated mistakes if the true model of the exchange rate is evolving over time. My results support the hypothesis that the exchange rate has followed a switching-regime process. Moreover, the switching-regime model estimated can explain about 75 percent of the bias implied by the forward market and the survey data.",Graciela Kaminsky,Graciela Kaminsky,,,,,,,,1

The paper uses a loglinear approximation to the budget constraint to substitute out consumption from a standard intertemporal asset pricing model. In a homoscedastic lognormal setting, the consumption--wealth ratio is shown to depend on the elasticity of intertemporal substitution in consumption, while asset risk premia are determined by the coefficient of relative risk aversion. Risk premia are related to the covariances of asset returns with the market return and with news about the discounted value of all future market returns.",John Y. Campbell,John Y. Campbell,,,,,,,,1

Compensating managers in proportion to a combination of profits and sales provides one mechanism through which aggressive behavior emerges. However, when the profit component of managerial compensation comes in the form of stock options, the aggressive behavior is restrained or even eliminated in equilibrium. This result relies only on the nonlinearity of the stock option; generalizations to other forms of compensation are discussed.",David Reitman,David Reitman,,,,,,,,1

Historical records and a simple game-theoretical model are used to examine this institution.

Employing a number of different aggregation procedures, we conclude that aggregate data alone are unlikely to produce reliable estimates of structural price and income coefficients. However, once certain ""aggregation factors"" as well as trend and seasonal components are included, an aggregate model is not necessarily outperformed across all demand equations in terms of forecasting ability.","Richard Blundell, Panos Pashardes and Guglielmo Weber",Richard Blundell,Panos Pashardes,Guglielmo Weber,,,,,,1

It is shown that the less uncertain are voters as to which policy is best, the more likely is a politician to manipulate policy for reelection purposes. Manipulation entails implementing the policy that is more likely to be well received rather than the one that maximizes income.","Joseph E. Harrington, Jr.","Joseph E. Harrington, Jr.",,,,,,,,1

This paper presents an explicitly dynamic search model which is able to account for cyclical patterns of prices and demand over time. These cyclical features of the model are the consequence of the dynamic strategic interaction between buyers and firms and do not require the presence of extraneous factors such as shocks or heterogeneity of agents in order to obtain. The model builds on earlier work by Kenneth Burdett and Kenneth L. Judd and may be interpreted as a dynamic extension of their model.,Chaim Fershtman and Arthur Fishman,Chaim Fershtman,Arthur Fishman,,,,,,,1

This enables him to refuse the contract in unfavorable states but burdens him with an observation cost. We show that the principal offers a contract in which the agent has no incentive to observe the state of nature, and we explore its terms. Later, we show that the principal finds it profitable to organize competition between several agents, even though he has monopoly power and can push a single agent down to his reservation utility.",Jacques Crémer and Fahad Khalil,Jacques Crémer,Fahad Khalil,,,,,,,1

The weak cartel can do no better than have its members submit identical bids. The strong cartel in effect reauctions the good among the cartel members.",R. Preston McAfee and John McMillan,R.

This paper explicitly adds a time dimension to an implementation problem and introduces a natural criterion of renegotiation-proofness for the case of time-consuming renegotiation. The main insight gained is that the addition of the time dimension enlarges significantly the set of contracts that can be implemented in a renegotiation-proof manner.,Ariel Rubinstein and Asher Wolinsky,Ariel Rubinstein,Asher Wolinsky,,,,,,,1

Yet a prominent feature of U.S. collective bargaining is the holdout: negotiations often continue without a strike after the contract has expired. Production continues with workers paid according to the expired contract. We analyze the union's decision to strike or hold out and highlight its importance to strike activity.

Aggregation using variable instead of fixed employment weights also greatly exaggerates the cyclicality of prewar wages.

Why is a fixed duration preferred to a stochastic duration that depends on the consumer price index? In this paper, the specification of the contract duration is determined endogeneously. The wage rate can be indexed to the consumer price index, but there is a loss since the indexation must be the same for different types of shocks. This loss increases with the variability of the contract duration. Since the loss due to the contracting cost depends on the expected discounted duration only, a fixed duration is chosen.",Leif Danziger,Leif Danziger,,,,,,,,1

The application of the procedure to postwar U.S. data suggests that consumption is smoother than the PIH model predicts.",Jordi Galí,Jordi Galí,,,,,,,,1

Estimating the service-price equation using recent data suggests that larger endowments of agricultural land, minerals, and capital, larger trade deficits, and higher prices for tradables increase service prices.

Thus, nominal rigidity arises from a failure to coordinate price changes.",Laurence Ball and David Romer,Laurence Ball,David Romer,,,,,,,1

In this setting, it is shown that there is often a Nash equilibrium in consumption that will keep the firm producing. Selfish consumers engage in excessive (beyond demand) consumption to keep the firm in business and to protect their surpluses. This is shown to be true in a simple model with perfect information and also in a more realistic model in which consumers are uncertain about the firm's costs.",Richard E. Romano,Richard E.

Capital:labor ratios also converged over the long period, though the process was much stronger after 1960. TFP catch-up is found to be positively associated with capital:labor growth and strongest when capital intensity is growing most rapidly. The United States overtook the United Kingdom in technological leadership in 1900 when its capital:labor growth was more than three times higher. The steady deterioration in the United Kingdom's relative TFP since 1900 and the United States' since 1950 are both associated with low rates of capital formation.",Edward N. Wolff,Edward N.

This paper argues that the reason is that these traditional summary statistics may not be closely related to a forecast's profits. Using profit measures, we find only very weak relationships between such summary error statistics and forecast value. If these results are robust, then least-squares regression analysis may not be appropriate for many studies of economic behavior.",Gordon Leitch and J. Ernest Tanner,Gordon Leitch,J.

This paper argues that classical statistical tests only indicate that there is not sufficient evidence to reject either specification and provides Bayesian analyses designed to reveal the relative support the data give to the two specifications.

Results on exogeneity and encompassing imply that our money demand model is interpretable as a model of money but not of prices, since its constancy holds only conditionally on contemporaneous prices.",David F.

Moreover, major credit card issuers have persistently earned from three to five times the ordinary rate of return in banking during the period 1983-1988. The failure of the competitive model appears to be partly attributable to consumers making credit card choices without taking account of the very high probability that they will pay interest on their outstanding balances.",Lawrence M.

Rather, they are consistent with a constant-returns-to-scale aggregate production function, so long as the exogenous Solow residual process has enough persistence in it. In our model, casuality runs exclusively from knowledge to capital, and therefore the apparent absence of an external effect to the capital input says nothing about the importance of spillovers in the creation of knowledge.",Jess Benhabib and Boyan Jovanovic,Jess Benhabib,Boyan Jovanovic,,,,,,,1

This dynamic pattern of protection emerges from a model in which countries choose levels of protection in a repeated game facing volatile trade swings. High trade volume leads to a greater incentive to defect unilaterally from cooperative tariff levels.

More surprisingly, the inability to raise revenue is shown to persist even when arbitrage across markets is possible as long as the quota is not too far from the free trade import level. This suggests that existing revenue estimates from auctioning quota licenses, which are based on the assumption of competition, are upwardly biased.

In such a case it is efficient to set the safety standard below the level of precaution that would be called for if the standard were used alone.","Charles D. Kolstad, Thomas S. Ulen and Gary V.

Evidence on monthly plant-level data shows that adjustment proceeds in jumps: Employment is unchanged in response to small shocks, but moves instantaneously to a new equilibrium if the shocks are large. Results in the large literature that assumes smooth adjustment are due to aggregation of this nonlinear relation. The finding has implications for cyclical changes in productivity, for examining severance pay, layoff, and plant-closing restrictions, and all other policies that affect the cost of adjusting employment.",Daniel S.

Business upturns improve net worth, lower agency costs, and increase investment, which amplifies the upturn; vice versa, for downturns.

Regulatory objectives are specified by appeal to standard human concerns and politics and processes peculiar to public-utility regulation. Constraints that serve the regulator are thereby derived, and connections between regulatory objectives and rules illuminated. Theoretical rationales emerge for ""rate-of-return"" regulation under certainty, and a largely neglected type of rate-of-return regulation under uncertainty. Motives of human regulators may explain other regulatory forms as well.",Lewis Evans and Steven Garber,Lewis Evans,Steven Garber,,,,,,,1

By contrast, regret theory is formulated in terms of actions, that is, n-tuples of state-contingent consequences. From the viewpoint of prospect-based theories, what appear to be innocuous rephrasings of choice problems are predicted by regret theory to cause people to reverse their choices.

In this theory, suboptimal contracts are put in place initially to protect one party against undesirable actions by another party and are renegotiated once the danger is past. We develop a model to establish the cases in which simple contracts cannot achieve desirable outcomes, so that only a complicated contract or renegotiation will serve.

Although most of the subjects diversified among the three risky assets, the introduction of a riskless asset did not have the effect predicted by the separation theorem, nor were the subjects affected by systematic changes in the variance-covariance matrix of the risky returns.

Thus, contrary to the theory developed by a number of writers, an operative bequest motive need not imply Ricardian equivalence. Since there is no uncertainty in the present analysis about the date of each individual's death, this conclusion does not depend on imperfections in annuity markets or on the existence of nonlump-sum taxes or other distortions. Rather it follows from the result derived below that, when future earnings are uncertain, bequests are uncertain and that consumption therefore rises more in response to an increase in current disposable income than to an equal present value increase in the disposable income of the next generation.",Martin Feldstein,Martin Feldstein,,,,,,,,1

In this model, the degree of competitiveness is measured by a parameter /eta = [(F - l)/F], where F is the number of firms in each sector. With fixed-wage contracts, sector-specific shocks generate aggregate fluctuations in employment and output through a multiplier effect. Introducing share contracts will not yield a Pareto-dominant allocation unless the share parameter is exactly equal to /eta. When the share parameter equals /eta, welfare is increased.

Measures of welfare change based on net compensating variations are computed for different types of families. These show that welfare differences due to changes in commodity prices are minor compared to welfare differences due to different income growth patterns over the decade.,Thomas M. Stoker,Thomas M.

A random utility model of bargainer preferences is developed and estimated. The estimates indicate that unions and employers have similar preferences: in favor of lawyers, more experienced arbitrators, and arbitrators who seem to have previously favored their side.

This is the first to contain data on both strikes and contract expirations. Key findings are that 15 percent of scheduled negotiations end as strikes, but strike probabilities are higher in June and lower in December; the variability, and not the level, of firm profitability affects strike activity; personal characteristics of the union workforce affect strike activity; and strikes are more likely when the local labor market is tight, but less likely when the industry labor market is tight.",Joseph S.
