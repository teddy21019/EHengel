We are again to see the drama which already in the course of the present century has passed before us, and closed in ruin. If the project shall be successful, we are again to see those paper missiles shooting in every direction through the country; a derangement of all value; a depreciated circulation; a suspension of specie payments; then a further extension of the same detestable paper; a still greater depreciation, with failures of traders and failures of banks in its train; to arrive at last at the same point from whence we departed in 1817.",Jacob P.

Continuous galloping inflation is found in some underdeveloped countries; Chile is perhaps the most extreme example. There can be no doubt that it retards growth (through lowering the allocative efficiency of the economy and discouraging savings) even if acute depressive reactions can be avoided.--Gottfried Haberler. The gross national product of Chile may well be a fifth to a fourth below what one would expect from the fine collection of resources at its disposal were it not for its chronic inflation and malallocations in resources that have occurred as a consequence of the direct controls that Chile has employed.--Theodore W. Schultz.",Tom E. Davis,,,,,,

A geometric model of this investment decision is examined. The currently pervasive ""income difference"" measure is shown to contain an upward bias positively related to the size of the investment. Alternative tests for ""shortage"" and ""surplus"" conditions are developed which correct for this bias. It is shown that labor supply schedules may bend backward only when the relevant wage changes are incorrectly anticipated. It also is shown that among individuals who differ only in wealth, those with less wealth will elect to invest in human capital at lower wage levels in the relevant employments.",C. M. Lindsay,,,,,,

Three problems are analyzed: (1) When should the collusive firms lower industry price to the limit price to prevent further entry? (2) Under what conditions should the collusive firms sacrifice immediate profits for a lower rate of entry which raises future profits? (3) How should the collusive firms respond to an actual lump of entry? It is shown that present value maximization by the collusive firms may require that immediate profits be sacrificed for a lower rate of entry. However, whether present value maximization requires either that immediate profits be sacrificed or maximized, the collusive firms should reduce output when faced with a lump of entry.",John T.

Executive financial incentives are found to be primarily related to firm stock market performance. The sales performance of the firm has no consistent positive or negative effect on executive financial return. The structures of individual firms' compensation packages were tested for effects on firm performance. It was found that firms with executives whose financial rewards more closely paralleled stockholders' interests performed better in the stock market over the postwar period. For this sample of firms it was concluded that the hypothesis of present-value maximization better explains firm behavior than the hypothesis of sales maximization. It is the conclusion of this author that the sales-maximization hypothesis does not usefully characterize the ""typical oligopolist,"" as has been asserted by William J. Baumol.",Robert Tempest Masson,,,,,,

The three rules are alternative versions of the ""safety-first"" principle; each is concerned with expected profits and with the probability of loss. Since the probability of loss can be identified with the firm's margin of safety, these rules can be viewed as alternative ways of making a compromise between expected profit maximization and high safety margins. They result in various output policies which can be most simply characterized as ""full cost"" or""safety margin"" pricing. Rules of thumb related to recovering full cost are therefore explained by the marginal analysis that was supposed by some to refute them.",Richard H. Day,Dennis J. Aigner,Kenneth R. Smith,,,,

We construct a formal decision-making model incorporating certain fundamental features of the industry. Within the context of the model we find that, under current rules of operation, equalization of playing strengths is generally not consistent with profit maximization by teams. However, we suggest a rule that guarantees convergence to a path of equal playing strengths under decentralized control of teams. As an example we study baseball leagues. Some refinements of the model are introduced, for example, incorporating time lags and training costs that result when teams train their own players.",Mohamed El-Hodiri,James Quirk,,,,,

This paper develops two models of replacement behavior--one with neutral and one with labor-saving technical change--under conditions of embodiment. Expressions for the optimal life of capital equipment are derived assuming environmental conditions consistent with the British and American textile sectors from the 1820s to the 1850s. The paper explores the influence of technical progress parameters, wages, interest rates, capital goods prices and output prices on the replacement decision. The paper concludes that tariff policy has had a significant impact on replacement and, further, that it helps shed considerable light on the divergent experience of these economies with the growth of industrial productivity.",Jeffrey G.

The model is formulated in discrete time, which brings out more clearly than the usual continuous-time version the crucial distinction between the short and the long run. In the long run there can be no stable relationship between investment and the rate of interest.

Section I summarizes the conventional distinctions between the dynamic loanable-funds and liquidity-preference theories of interest and between the dynamic quantity and expenditure theories of prices. Sections II and III develop the concepts of notional demand and gradual market clearing, which are essential in the conventional analysis. The next three sections develop a choice-theoretic theory of effective demands, starting in Section IV with a generalization of Clower's dual-decision hypothesis to a multimarket context. Section V analyzes the determination of quantity constraints on individual transactions implied by market disequilibriums. Section VI deals with aggregation of the individual effective-demands functions. Finally, Section VII shows how the aggregate effective demands determine the dynamic behavior of the interest rate and price level, and Section VIII shows that the traditional dynamic theories mentioned above are all special cases of the more general effective-demands theory. A priori, the dynamic loanable-funds, liquidity-preference, quantity, and expenditure theories all turn out to be consistent with the structure of exchange in a monetary economy. Which better approximates reality depends upon choice-theoretic behavioral parameters which determine the pattern of response to the constraints imposed by market disequilibriums.",Herschel I.

An international cross-section of developed countries indicates that the best-fitting demand function for money has constant elasticities and the best-fitting relationship between the rate of secular inflation and the magnitude of recessions indeed has a constant elasticity of about -1.

A competitive equilibrium in the presence of technological externalities in production is compared with a Pareto optimum in terms of input use and final outputs of the economy.

It is maintained that the double infinity of traders and dated commodities allows for competitive equilibria that are not Pareto-optimal.

The chain-letter aspect of the model reminds us that the appropriate form of the budget constraint is not obvious for the potentially infinitely long-lived economic entity (such as the corporation or the family).

The choice of how much to produce and sell in each country, how much to export between the two, and what transfer price to put on intrafirm exports is shown to depend heavily on two considerations: (1) whether the marginal costs of production are rising or falling, and (2) whether tariffs are high enough for the firm to discriminate perfectly between its two national markets. After showing how the firm reacts to a given set of tariffs on imports and taxes on profits, the impact of a change in any policy variable is assessed.",Thomas Horst,,,,,,

His indifference curves in the expected return-risk space are shown to be convex to the origin under the assumption of decreasing risk preference, and his efficient opportunity locus is in general discontinuous and convex. The optimal portfolio for such a risk-preferrer may be a diversified one, composed of several lottery and nonlottery assets. Diversification requires that there be lotteries which offer substantially higher risk than those attaching to assets with higher expected yield, making gambling an activity distinct from business investments. Risk taking and the purchase of lotteries is shown to decrease relatively with wealth.",J. C. Handa,,,,,,

Regression results with uncovered interest differentials as variables suggest that U.K. short-term capital flows were sensitive to changes in interest rates and in trade flows and to speculation.

Viewing migration as a decision to invest in human capital, we postulate that migration flows are directly related to net present values of the investment decisions. A regression equation derived from the theoretical model contains two independent variables--the expected value of earnings differentials and a distance variable. Cross-section regression results are reported for each of ten provinces, but statistical considerations led to grouping the data into four multiprovince regions. Despite their essential simplicity, the four equations yield highly significant results, accounting for about one-half to two thirds of the variation in interprovincial migration.",Gene Laber,Richard X.

The usual answer--the rate at which the inflation elasticity of demand for real balances is unity--is correct if real income is constant but wrong if real income is rising. The answer then depends also on the growth rate and on the income elasticity of demand for real balances. The revenue-maximizing rate of inflation is generally lower for growing than for constant real income and may even be negative, that is, deflation. Many actual rates of inflation seem higher than the revenue-maximizing rate.",Milton Friedman,,,,,,

Marginal value products for land and labor were obtained from fitting data to a Cobb-Douglas production function for each grain crop. These values were then equalized by the method of iteration and substituted in the original production function to obtain the maximum income obtainable had peasants allocated their resources with maximum efficiency.

Previous studies concerned with local government behavior indicate that income has a large effect on education expenditures. There is the possibility that essentially the same relationship is being measured, with dependent and independent variables merely interchanged. In this study, the equations are estimated simultaneously. To see why single- and simultaneous-equations estimates differ, expressions are developed for sources of single-equation bias.The major reason for a large single-equation bias in estimating the effect of education on income is found to be the relatively large reverse effect of income on education, which makes for high correlation between independent variable and residual in the equation for income. Single-equation bias in the equation explaining education expenditures is small for the same underlying reason, namely the reverse effect occurring in the equation is relatively small. A by-product is an analysis of demand for education allowing for effects of different forms of wealth, in contrast to the usual approach assuming one overall wealth or income effect. Nonhuman wealth is estimated to have twice as much effect on education expenditures as other forms of wealth.",G. S. Tolley,E. Olson,,,,,

The interrelatedness of research with procedures for applying the research findings is investigated; in the case of polio, the rate of return on research is found to be heavily influenced by the costs of application.

Subject to a number of assumptions, the model developed here indicates that, in the period 1960-64, a reallocation of capital and labor that equalized factor returns among the main Soviet industrial sectors, holding the level and mix of output constant, would have freed resources with an annual value equal to 3-4 percent of value added in the industries covered.",Judith Thornton,,,,,,

Whether mergers and acquisitions will increase or decrease concentration depends upon the size distribution of the acquired assets among the firms that survive. Some data from the U.S. economy are consistent with a set of conditions under which industrial concentration is unaffected by mergers, thus offering an explanation for the observed fact that the overall concentration of U.S. firms, as measured by the slope of the Pareto curve, has not changed substantially since the turn of the century. The findings challenge the widely held view that mergers held view that mergers ""obviously"" increase concentration and reduce competition.",Yuji Ijiri,Herbert A. Simon,,,,,

The model combines one element from Irving Fisher (the difference between the nominal and the real interest rate) and one element from John Maynard Keynes (the determination of market interest rates by speculators with firmly held anticipations) with two empirical assumptions (a unit real income elasticity of demand for money and an exogenous excess of the real interest rate over the real secular rate of growth). The result is a model connecting current nominal income with current and prior nominal quantities of money.,Milton Friedman,,,,,,

The connecting link between the two is furnished by the fact that, under conditions of ""competition among a few,"" the output decisions of an individual firm have a random effect on its own revenues. It is shown that considerations of uncertainty influence the capacity or utilization decisions in a manner which is fundamentally different from that under ""pure"" competition. In the latter case, a production decision of an individual firm does not change the probability distribution of market prices. This and some related considerations make it practically useful to interpret ""capacity"" in terms of profitable output--allowing the standards of profitability to be quite arbitrary. Defined in terms of profitable output, capacity emerges as a random variable--random because of the uncertain fulfillment of the standards of profitability. It is also seen that the usual interpretation of the present-value integral is to be abandoned in favor of another which, on a formal level, has close ties with the theory of integration over the space of random functions.",S.

Hence in order to ensure that resources do flow into the export sector to the ""desire"" extent, the discrepancy between the marginal profitabilities of investment in the export sector and the import-substitution sector that the Scheme fails to correct must also be minimized by equalizing the subsidies on exports and those on the production of importables produced at home.

It then shows how the effect of technical progress on the demand for different kinds of labor may be modeled by means of shift parameters within the aggregation function, and provides estimates for them and the other parameters of the aggregation function using time series data for the United States as a whole. The results assembled in the paper indicate that, for the purpose of estimating total growth in output due to labor, a time-dependent CES function with a fine classification of labor should yield the most accurate predictions, provided that the shift parameters can be estimated. Otherwise, there is little to be gained by going beyond wage-weighted linear aggregation. For educational planners, the most obvious implication of the results is that the manpower requirements approach should be abandoned. They suggest that rate-ofreturn analysis with constant relative wage rates should be a less misleading tool for planning, at least in the short run. However, since such analysis is sensitive to changes in wage differentials, and since these in turn are sensitive to the specification of the aggregation structure, it would be much better still to use the CES function approach to obtain a feedback relationship between the growth of the different levels of the educational system and the rates of return to them, via the growth of the labor force and the structure of wages.

The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to enumerate a few of the more fundamental conceptual differences between the monetary analysis of Keynes and that of Friedman.

Conversely, Friedman detracts from the true quantity theory by stating that its formal short-run analysis assumes real output constant, while only prices change, Friedman also incorrectly characterizes Keynesian economics in terms of absolute price rigidity. He does this by overlooking the systematic analysis by Keynes and the Keynesians of the role of downward wage flexibility during unemployment, and of the “inflationary gap” during full employment. Otherwise Friedman’s interpretation of Keynes is the standard textbook one of an economy in a “liquiditytrap” unemployment equilibrium.

The amount of revenue generated by a steady inflation is derived as a function of the inflation rate and some underlying parameters. Empirically, the revenue-maximizing rate is on the order of 140 percent per month with the corresponding revenue approximating 15 percent of national income. It is argued that hyperinflations become unstable when the revenue-maximizing rate is exceeded. Because inflation leads to higher transaction costs (resulting from greater payment frequencies and reduced use of “money” as a payments medium), there is a net social cost attached to inflationary finance.

https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/259947,Optimal Economic Stabilization Policy: An Extended Framework,80,5,Sep. - Oct.,1972,"This paper outlines an optimization framework which extends the familiar Tinbergen-Theil model in two ways. First, a “piecewise quadratic” replaces the standard quadratic objective function. Second, the time horizon of the optimization becomes, within the context of economic stabilization problems, endogenous to the optimization process itself. The purpose of both extensions is to escape the conceptual restrictiveness of the Tinbergen-Theil structure while preserving the practical convenience of that model for applied policy work. The paper also describes a solution algorithm incorporating these two extensions, and it presents the results of a sample computational application based on the 1957-58 recession. ",Benjamin M.

Market insurance and self-insurance are shown to be substitutes, but market insurance and self-protection can be complements. The analysis challenges the notion that “moral hazard” is an inevitable consequence of market insurance, by showing that under certain conditions the latter may lead to a reduction in the probabilities of hazardous events.

The argument behind this view is that the monopoly power of the large firms ultimately depends on their ability to inhibit entry and the growth of smaller firms. No static measure of concentration can reflect this ability because it can only be measured over a period of time. The main part of the paper is concerned with developing and interpreting new measures that would incorporate within them the power, or lack of power, of the large firms to inhibit entry and the growth of smaller firms. In developing these measures, the starting point is the work of Friedman and Kuznets in measuring the permanent component of an income distribution. The market shares of the firms are divided into permanent and transitory components, and the paper shows that by comparison of observed market shares for two different periods of time it is possible to infer measures of concentration that are based upon the permanent component of the shares. These measures of permanent concentration incorporate within them the ability of the large firms to inhibit entry and the growth of smaller firms.       ",Irvin M. Grossack,,,,,,2.0

The results imply that in 1967 the ratio of black to white male wages might have been 4 percent higher in the industrial union sector and 5 percent lower in the craft union sector than they would have been in the absence of all unionism. ,Orley Ashenfelter,,,,,,2.0

Of particular interest are questions concerning the possibility of steady growth in a capitalist economy and the determination of the rate of profits. It is shown that. for an economy in a state of reproduction, the scheme provides an internally consistent theory of the profit rate when the rate of exploitation is taken as given. The associated path of accumulation over time, derived under different assumptions concerning investment behavior, displays possible sources of imbalance, including those found by Harrod.

It is assumed that individuals inherit an initial stock of health that depreciates with age and can be increased by investment. In this framework, the “shadow price” of health depends on many other variables besides the price of medical care. It is shown that the shadow price rises with age if the rate of depreciation on the stock of health rises over the life cycle and falls with education if more educated people are more efficient producers of health. Of particular importance is the conclusion that, under certain conditions, an increase in the shadow price may simultaneously reduce the quantity of health demanded and increase the quantity of medical care demanded.

Social returns are estimated through a combination of the import substitution and income creation approaches, both of which are considered in the evaluation of investment. The cost-benefit analysis of a major national project in India within this framework shows that its educational program has a positive net present value even at a social discount rate as high as 13 percent. The net returns appear to be quite sensitive to the values assigned to the foreign exchange rate, discount rate, and price elasticity. ",Samuel Paul,,,,,,2.0

Double-log demand functions resulting therefrom are composed of the real income effect and the relative price effect. I show that the income elasticities and the own-price elasticities of demand are (approximately) constant (an assumption almost invariably made in applications) when the utility function is a generalized CES type. The income elasticity of marginal utility is the overall elasticity of substitution with no cardinal implications that Frisch stressed upon. The paper examines how approximate the constancy assumption is. A comparison is made with the linear expenditure system that is a special case.

This paper relaxes that assumption by specifying a multiperiod-consumption function which introduces age-distribution parameters explicitly into the model. This is accomplished by specifying a multiperiod constant-elasticity-of-substitution (CES) type utility function where the consumer’s time horizon is determined by various age-distribution parameters such as median age, retirement age, etc. The proportion of lifetime income spent on current consumption is shown to depend on the rate of interest, the age-distribution parameters, and the parameters of the utility function. Lifetime income, in turn, depends on the interest rates and age parameters. The model, which is nonlinear, is estimated using annual data from 1948 to 1965. The effects of changes in interest rates and age parameters are assessed, and a prediction-interval test is applied to the model. ",Dale M. Heien,,,,,,2.0

Although job-search theory seems to provide a choice-theoretic basis for the relationship between aggregate demand and employment, the paper points out that prominent qualitative aspects of the predicted relationship between aggregate demand and employment are empirically unacceptable. In particular, the analysis of employment-acceptance friction (1) does not allow for layoffs and nonwage rationing of jobs, (2) predicts that cyclical variations in employment will involve countercyclical variation in real wages rates, and (3) predicts that cyclical variations in employment will involve countercyclical variations in consumption expenditures. As an alternative, the paper suggests that analysis of friction in the process by which markets are cleared can provide a more satisfactory theoretical basis for the causal relationship between aggregate demand and employment.",Herschel I.

One major result is that while predominantly wheat areas show constant returns to scale, diminishing returns seem to prevail in predominantly paddy areas. But both in paddy and wheat agriculture the observed negative relation between output per acre and farm size is likely to be the result more of an inverse relation between size and other inputs than of scale diseconomies.

The statistical hypothesis that aging does not affect the distance elasticity whereas increasing education strongly diminishes the absolute value of the distance elasticity is accepted.

https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/260084,A Theory of Marriage: Part I,81,4,Jul. - Aug.,1973,"I present in this paper the skeleton of a theory of marriage. The two basic assumptions are that each person tries to do as well as possible and that the ""marriage market"" is in equilibrium. With the aid of several additional simplifying assumptions, I derive a number of significant implications about behavior in this market. For example, the gain to a man and woman from marrying compared to remaining single is shown to depend positively on their incomes, human capital, and relative difference in wage rates. The theory also implies that men differing in physical capital, education or intelligence (aside from their effects on wage rates), height, race, or many other traits will tend to marry women with like values of these traits, whereas the correlation between mates for wage rates or for traits of men and women that are close substitutes in household production will tend to be negative. The theory does not take the division of output between mates as given, but rather derives it from the nature of the marriage market equilibrium. The division is determined here, as in other markets, by marginal productivities, and these are affected by the human and physical capital of different persons, sex ratios (that is, the relative numbers of men and women), and some other variables.",Gary S.

It is shown that long lags by themselves do not impair the effectiveness of active stabilization policy and in fact require its more vigorous use. Variability in lags does reduce the effectiveness of stabilization policy and requires its more cautious use; the relative performance of alternative policies depends upon whether the variability of lags is confined to the direct effects of policy or occurs in the dynamics of the whole system. The cautious use of active stabilization policy is shown to be always stabilizing relative to performance under an inactive policy.,Stanley Fischer,J. Phillip Cooper,,,,,

The absence of data on the flows of intermediate goods makes it impossible to estimate separate production functions for more than one product.

The economic implications of these specifications are discussed, and a general specification is proposed in which it is possible to test the two specifications.",Robert E. Hall,,,,,,

Primary emphasis is placed on the effect of a change in the real value of money on real expenditure and on the effects on relative prices of a redistribution of expenditure between countries. The stability properties of the model are related to the transfer problem in barter theory and to the Marshall-Lerner condition.

Theorems and behavioral implications are derived using the state preference approach to behavior under uncertainty. The investigation deals directly with the interaction between offense and defense: crime and collective law enforcement. It indicates the existence of a deterrent effect of law-enforcement activity on all crimes and a strong positive correlation between income inequality and crimes against property. The empirical results also provide some tentative estimates of the effectiveness of law enforcement in reducing crime and the resulting social losses.,Isaac Ehrlich,,,,,,

The results suggest that outside experience is quite important, and that it is substitutable, to a great extent, for inside experience.

This achieves increased agency size, which is more likely to increase managerial compensation than to maximize net social benefits, the assumed goal of the conventional public investment model. To increase agency size, managers must often resort to projects with low or negative return rates. The selection of such projects is possible because transactions costs are sufficiently large to bar successful opposition by disaffected taxpayers. The analysis as well as empirical evidence suggests that inefficient public projects are the rule rather than the exception.",David L. Shapiro,,,,,,

The central concept of the analysis is “social income,” the sum of a person’s own income (his earnings, etc.) and the monetary value to him of the relevant characteristics of others, which I call his social environment. By using the concept of social income, I can analyze the effect on these expenditures of changes in different sources of income and in different prices, including the “price” of the social environment. Interactions among members of the same family receive the greatest attention. The “head” of a family is defined not by sex or age, but as that member, if there is one, who transfers general purchasing power to all other members because he cares about their welfare. A family with a head is a highly interdependent organization that has the following properties: A redistribution of income among members does not affect the consumption or welfare of any member because it simply induces offsetting changes in transfers from the head. Not only the head but other members too act “as if” they “loved” all members, even when they are really selfish, in the sense that they maximize not their own income alone but family income. Transfers from parents to children in the form, say, of schooling, gifts, and bequests tend to be negatively related to what the income of children would be relative to their parents in the absence of these transfers. Therefore, the relative income of children inclusive of transfers could be unrelated or even negatively related to these transfers. Consequently, one cannot infer anything about the stability across generations of economic or social positions simply from knowing the relation between parental position and the amount transferred.

The higher his wage demands, the higher the wage he can expect, though the probability of finding an adequate job is lower. When comparing wages of different population groups, one must take their different search policies into account. Ignoring these differences results in a selectivity bias. This bias is particularly relevant for the secondary labor groups; it may distort our conclusions about malefemale and white-nonwhite wage differentials, the age-carning profiles, the rate of return and the rate of depreciation of human capital, and the determinants of labor-force participation.

Their competition with each other and with the next lower brackets drive down pretax rates of return on such investments. As a result, although the tax system is less progressive than the rate structure alone makes it appear, it is more progressive than it would appear if we look only at net economic incomes and taxes.

And yet, although Smith unqualifiedly treats high wages as desirable, he treats high profits as undesirable. Why did so eloquent a spokesman for capitalism and laissez faire treat high profits with such unrelieved hostility?

In the first model capital is treated as a specific factor in each industry, with labor mobile between industries. The assumption of specificity determines the direction of factor income changes, with magnitudes depending on substitutability between factors and on intensities of factor use within the two industries. In the second model, capital is viewed as a quasi-fixed factor. For the short run, this model is identical to the model first considered. For the long run, this model is identical to the Stolper-Samuelson model in which the direction and magnitude of factor income changes depend solely on relative factor intensities. The difference between the short-run and long-run determinants of changes in factor incomes gives rise to a conflict between factor owners’ short-run and long-run interests. ",Michael Mussa,,,,,,2.0

Critics have argued that, if exclusion is costless, the proposition is false. Underlying this argument, however, is the assumption that preference maps of consumers are known. In this paper, this assumption is relaxed. It is shown that a system of atomistic competition will lead to suboptimal levels of public goods, and that those public goods which are produced will be inefficiently allocated. Furthermore, owing to different intensities of use, units of public goods will command different prices. However, for any particular unit of public good, price will be the same for all individuals.

But three predictions in the spirit of the hypothesis are not in fact borne out. First, rates of return to uncompleted courses (dropouts) are as high as to completed courses. Second, standardized educational differentials rise with age, although employers have better information about older employees’ abilities. Third, if screening is the main function of education, it could be done more cheaply by simpler testing procedures. Yet these are not used widely despite the profits that could, according to the hypothesis, be made by those developing them. ",Richard Layard,George Psacharopoulos,,,,,2.0
https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/260252,Research and Development Activity and Profitability: A Distributed Lag Analysis,82,5,Sep. - Oct.,1974,"There are at least three ways in which profits and R & D may be related. First, profits may influence subsequent R & D. Second, R & D may influence subsequent profits. And third, it is possible that R & D and profits are influenced simultaneously by some third factor. For example, government support or exogenous surges in demand could increase both at the same time. Although the first two of these relations involve influences of one variable on another over time, the problem of distinguishing between a simultaneous and a recursive relation has not been tackled in previous work. The current study employs distributed lag techniques with pooled time-series and cross-section data to discriminate among the alternative types of time relations. A sample of seven industries containing 111 firms covering the 1950-65 period was used to test these relations. The results indicate a tendency for R & D to influence future profitability and to be influenced by past profitability. ",Ben Branch,,,,,,2.0

Economists have derived a number of results characterizing the effects of various changes on optimal-search behavior. Almost without exception, these results depend on the untenable assumption that searchers know the probability distribution from which they are searching. This paper studies the effect of assuming instead that searchers learn about the probability distribution while they search from it. Not invariably, but in many instances, the qualitative properties of optimal-search strategies—and thus the behavior of those who follow them—are the same as in the simpler case when the distribution is assumed known.

The entire U.S. tax structure is then shown to be roughly equivalent to the optimal structure.

Capital flows are viewed as the mechanism by which a domestic excess demand for money is removed and consequently the key explanatory variables in the model are changes in domestic income, the currentaccount balance, changes in domestic monetary instruments, and changes in foreign interest rates since these will all affect either the demand for or supply of money.

Calculations covering the period 1960-69 for developed countries and U.S. holdings of bonds, equities, and direct investment in manufacturing showed that private rates of return generally were positive but that social rates of return from investing abroad rather than domestically were strongly negative, assuming zero marginal government expenditures and disregarding all externalities.

Argentine agricultural stagnation has been partially attributed to a lack of producer price response, but this paper shows that the cattle sector exhibits strong price response and that producers correctly differentiate their behavior toward animals of different age and sex. The long-run price response of slaughter is positive, but the short-run response is negative because animals must be withheld to permit increases in future output. This negative short-run response implies that devaluation is unlikely to increase beef exports for at least 2 years. ",Lovell S. Jarvis,,,,,,2.0

The concept of Bayesian learning is introduced. Consistent and rational expectations are introduced in models where the firms cannot immediately move to equilibrium. Three different models are developed which demonstrate the interaction of Bayesian learning and expectations in achieving a market equilibrium. These models are dynamic and describe the transition process toward equilibrium. Two of the models involve unknown parameters about which the firms learn. The third is a control theory model explicitly involving adjustment costs. ,Richard M. Cyert,Morris H. DeGroot,,,,,2.0

Furthermore, the implications of a change in expected price remain unchanged, but those of a change in input price need not be the same as in the certainty case. Specifically, the input demand function is downward sloping only if the production function is well behaved. ",Raveendra N. Batra,Aman Ullah,,,,,2.0

It emerges that the GPSR defined to include consumer durables expenditures and the imputed return on durables has no trend over the period and that its year-to-year variation is extremely small except for the World War I, World War II, and Great Depression years. This stability prevailed in the face of pronounced shifts in the composition of private savings from personal saving to durables expenditure and corporate saving, and a redistribution of income from the private to public sectors. The notion of ultrarationality, in which households subsume corporate and government spending and saving in their budget decisions, is used to explain the stability of the GPSR despite the important changes in its composition. Leading implications of this stability for theory and policy are explored: one important conclusion is that, under full employment, fiscal policy  can neither affect aggregate expenditure nor alter the ratio of investment to consumption.

The profit rates used in these studies are based on treating advertising expenditures as a current expense. Much evidence exists that advertising has a long-lasting effect on sales, so that the treatment of advertising as a current expense is inappropriate. In this paper, corrected profit rates are calculated by treating advertising expenditures as an investment in a capital asset. The corrected profit rates are then used in a multivariate regression analysis of the relationship between profitability, market structure, and advertising intensity. No significant relationship between corrected profit rates and advertising intensity is found in the regressions. This finding suggests that the positive relationships between uncorrected profit rates and advertising intensity in previous studies are due solely to the inappropriate expensing of advertising.

Some expectations as to the slope of these curves were gleaned from the literature and incorporated into three simple models—“linear,” “quadratic,” and “interactive.” Separate ordinary least-squares regression of the offers and counteroffers for each side and each strike showed that the explanatory power of even such simple models was quite high, especially for management.

It is shown analytically that the greater the decay rate, the greater the concavity. The other is an effect of mergers and acquisitions. Based on Federal Trade Commission data, the actual firm-size distribution in 1969 is compared with a hypothetical one where all mergers and acquisitions in 1948-69 were “undone” to demonstrate their effect.

The Soviet economy is divided into agricultural and nonagricultural sectors. Each sector is approximated by a Cobb-Douglas production function. Special output, labor, and capital indices are then used in order to compare the actual with the hypothetical growth of the Soviet economy. The conclusion reached is that in absence of centralized planning, the growth of the USSR would have been the same or better. ",Micha Gisser,Paul Jonas,,,,,2.0

Both the original legislation and subsequent administrative rulings require participating cities to give preference in hiring to residents of the target areas—the urban ghetto. Yet, by the spring of 1971, fewer than half the positions were held by ghetto residents. Moreover, nonresidents were being paid significantly higher salaries than residents. ‘This paper attempts to identify the determinants of intercity variation in “resident participation rates” and the causes of the resident/ nonresident differences in earnings. It was found that cities with highly structured bureaucracies and/or strong mayors allocate a larger share of Model Cities jobs to “outsiders” than is the case for other cities. On the other hand, real or potential “black power” (as measured, for example, by whether or not the city experienced a major civil disorder in 1967) increases ghetto participation in the Model Cities Program. Analysis of more than 14,000 individual employee records shows that neither occupational “crowding” nor lack of educational credentials sufficiently explains the salary differences between ghetto and nonghetto Model Cities workers.

Optimally taxing or controlling pollution may or may not lead to a decline in production of polluting goods. Moreover, taxation reorders production and consumption patterns in the city so that the minimum net effect on welfare of city inhabitants is the decline in pollution. Since pollution taxation increases the welfare of city inhabitants, city size rises with immigration from the rest of the economy. ",J. V. Henderson,,,,,,2.0

Among the results are (a) international prices should be used for evaluating public projects, unless there is a government budgetary constraint or there is a quota (this result does not require that tariff rates be optimally chosen); (6) no tariff should be levied on intermediates and only consumption taxes should be employed if there are 100 percent profit taxes.

One important innovation is to introduce into the consumption bundle a commodity which is purchased less frequently than income is received. A second innovation is to consider household use of earning assets as a store of savings balances rather than working balances. The analysis shows that the effects of inflationary expectations on optimal commodity inventories and money holdings depend critically on whether the household holds part of its savings balance as earning assets. For example, if the household holds its savings balance only as money, and if the real rate of return on earning assets is constant, an increase in the expected rate of inflation would induce a reduction in total money holdings and also, somewhat surprisingly, a reduction in total commodity inventories.",Herschel I.

But the rational expectations assumption that economic agents have learned from their mistaken predictions of the past ignores the transition period during which new information is combined with old information in the formation of new beliefs. The purpose of this paper is to examine the possible effects of monetary policy during this transition period. Using a simple momentary Phillips curve model and a particular characterization of monetary policy, it is shown that real variables (in this case unemployment) can be controlled. Further, an optimal monetary policy is computed by simple variational methods. This policy is a randomized rule which matches the marginal gain from future reductions in unemployment to the marginal loss of increased uncertainty about the price level. Unlike the rational expectations equilibrium, this rule will dominate purely deterministic rules, even if the latter are possible.",John B. Taylor,,,,,,

The large herding animals that became extinct, such as mammoth, bison, camel, and mastodon, presented low hunting cost and high kill value. The absence of appropriation provided incentives for the wastage killing evident in some kill sites, while the slow growth, long lives, and long maturation of large animals increased their vulnerability to extinction. Free-access hunting is compared with socially optimal hunting and used to interpret the development of conservationist ethics, and controls, in more recent primitive cultures.",Vernon L. Smith,,,,,,
https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/260354,Pressure Groups and the Pattern of Tariffs,83,4,Aug.,1975,"An economic theory of the effectiveness of industrial pressure groups in obtaining favorable tariffs is developed and tested for the United States Tariff Act of 1824. Import duties bestow nonexclusive benefits on factors of production or costs on product users. From the theory of public goods, it is postulated that small, homogeneous, geographically concentrated groups would react more intensely to the expected effects of tariffs in attempting to influence the legislature. However, in Congress (where majority support was necessary) it was a disadvantage for an import duty to be identified as too local or narrow an interest. This paper attempts empirically to sort out these conflicting forces, and finds inter alia that the ideal industry pressure groups in 1824 had low proprietorial income shares and geographically concentrated production units, but that political effectiveness required the group to speak for many establishments with output spread fairly evenly across states.",J.

Households occupying the 57,000 subsidized dwelling units received net benefits of 25.6 million, or 450 per household, in 1968. The public subsidy required to provide these benefits was 46.9 million, or 824 per unit. Hence, rather substantial nontenant benefits of 21.3 million, or 374 per unit, would have had to be generated by the program for it to be considered an efficient use of resources. Net benefits to participants were found to rise with age of household head and family size, to be lower for female-headed households, and to show little relation to income level. However, net benefits varied considerably for otherwise similar households. Finally, program participants were found to differ little on average from those occupying private, unsubsidized rental housing in New York City in 1968.",Joseph S. DeSalvo,,,,,,

It is shown that a slight generalization of the permanent income or ""life-cycle"" model of consumption makes each individual's lifetime marginal propensity to consume a fraction of his lifetime disposable resources unless two taste parameters are equal. In considering what this implies for the aggregate consumption function, the tenuous connection between theoretical constructs and observed facts is stressed. Previous empirical work on the subject is criticized for failing to define properly either ""income distribution"" or ""consumption,"" and a new test, based on the theory, is outlined. Because of data limitations, a number of compromises with this ideal test must be made, and several alternative models are estimated. On the whole, they suggest that equalizing the distribution of income would either leave aggregate consumption unchanged or diminish it slightly.",Alan S. Blinder,,,,,,

The rate of inflation is uncertain. In a setting where all income is from capital gains, it is shown that index bonds command a premium over nominal bonds only if equity is not a hedge against inflation; it is also shown that, if there are homogeneous expectations and no outside bonds, all lending and borrowing will be through index bonds with no nominal bonds existing.

The central issue is to determine equilibrium output, capacity, and the utilization of capacity when the market is organized as a franchised monopoly, through a medallion system, and when there is free entry, and to exhibit the relationship among these variables and prices, cost of capacity and output, and policies of the regulator. It is found that many of the characteristics of taxi markets that would appear to confirm the monopolistic-competition thesis arise because of the nature of regulation of these markets.",Arthur S.

The recently introduced Yale Tuition Postponement Option is used to illustrate a number of difficult problems involved in actual implementation of the Friedman proposal.

Because the special charge on any one person is not paid to any other person, a very small budget surplus results. Applications to both discrete and continuous decisions are illustrated.",T.

https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/260506,Expectations and Exchange Rate Dynamics,84,6,Dec.,1976,"The paper develops a theory of exchange rate movements under perfect capital mobility, a slow adjustment of goods markets relative to asset markets, and consistent expectations. The perfect foresight path is derived and it is shown that along that along that path a monetary expansion causes the exchange rate to depreciate. An initial overshooting of exchange rates is shown to derive from differential adjustment speed of markets. The magnitude and persistence of the overshooting is developed in terms of the structural parameters of the model. To the extent that output responds to a monetary expansion in the short run, this acts a a dampening effect on exchange depreciation and may, in fact, lead to an increase in interest rates.",Rudiger Dornbusch,,,,,,

A tax will induce, then, substitution within the commodity away from the taxed attributes and into the others. The results of a test on cigarettes are consistent with our prediction that the effects of unit and ad valorem taxes will differ both from each other and from those predicted by the conventional model. It is shown that, although the market will adjust in numerous changeable characteristics, the adjustment is constrained by the condition that the sum of the dollar value of the inefficiencies and of tax paid is minimized.",Yoram Barzel,,,,,,

This judgement has been supplemented with a more personal one of scientific fruitfulness. He had one overwhelming and proper success--the theorem on resource allocation under competition--and several minor successes. He also had one modest success that was improper (i.e., unfortunate)--the distinction between productive and unproductive labor. Smith's most important analytical failure was the hierarchy of employments of capital. Three failures that should have been successes receive special attention: his wage theory, his rent theory, and the analysis of the division of labor.

The paper also compares the corrected results of the Harberger model with those achieved with an algorithmic solution procedure for a general equilibrium model.

The model is estimated by a consistent-systems technique, with data pertaining to the rolling stock of class-I line-haul railways in the United States from 1944-70. The empirical results indicate that maintenance expenditures are determined by gross additions to and retirements from the rolling stock as well as by the cost of funds and the rate of utilization. Moreover, in light of the uncovered rade-offs between maintenance expenditures and gross investment, the paper concludes that in estimating investment models, a proxy for maintenance expenditures should be included among the independent variables.",George C.

By 1970, however, the bulk of U.S. electricity generation was by firms operating in the essentially flat area of the average cost curve.

The individual's search for jobs and the firm's search for employees are affected by the shape of the earnings function--and, thus, by age and education in a predictable way.

It is known that the full optimum can, in general, be attained only through the imposition of excise taxes at different levels for different individuals. Since these may be ruled out (possibly because of implementation costs), one is confined to consider second-best taxes. The common interpretation of the Pigouvian principle has called for taxes on the externality-creating commodities. With no relationships between the consumption of different commodities the Pigouvian principle is obviously impeccable. But the existence of substitutes or complements for an externality-causing commodity raises the possibility of indirect policies: treating the externality through the markets for related goods. Obviously, if the direct policy is not feasible, the indirect treatment may provide some partial remedy. We show, however, that even when direct policies are available, the overall optimum may involve only indirect policies. An example with such a result is provided in the paper. We also list a number of cases in which the traditional prescription is confirmed, and the overall optimum involves only direct policies.",Jerry Green,Eytan Sheshinski,,,,,

It is argued, however, that uncertainty of the inflation rate doesn't change much during the sample period (1953-71).

The concept provides a middle ground between ""autoregressive"" expectation formation and ""rational"" expectation formation. A necessary condition for the use of nonnegligible cost information sets is that such sets serve as leading indicators or more formally satisfy the causality conditions of Granger (1969). Using a time series modeling identification methodology developed by Box and Jenkins (1970) and Haugh (1972), we test the causal relationship between the rate of inflation and various monetary and fiscal aggregates. Surprisingly, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the rate of inflation is independent of the monetary and fiscal aggregates considered. Since the proposed leading indicator series contain no incremental predictive power once the information contained in the past history of inflation is efficiently utilized, we conclude that autoregressive expectation models may indeed represent economically rational price expectation formation.",Edgar L.

Search creates a stochastic stream of customers. Searchers observe the queue and leave if it is too long. Production is random. In the optimal solution, waiting time, effective demand, and the utilization of capacity are jointly determined. Product quality in the form of waiting time is endogenous to the model, and it is found that price or capacity changes affect both the quantity and the quality of output. If an equilibrium exists, there is excess capacity. Price equals marginal cost, but monopoly produces too little capacity and output unless profits are zero.",Arthur De Vany,,,,,,

These shadow prices are compared with the corresponding free-trade and actual market prices. It is shown that if the distortion is an output subsidy or tax on existing production, the optimal intervention for new projects is subsidies and taxes on primary factors equal to the difference between the shadow prices and the market prices and not an output subsidy or single shadow exchange rate to provide offsetting protection for the new project. It is also shown that projects viable under free trade may reduce welfare if they are introduced into a distorted economy, while projects that would increase welfare in these circumstances might not be viable under free trade.",Ronald Findlay,Stanislaw Wellisz,,,,,

Effects in 1975 are simulated using data from a 1970 health care survey. The findings are as follows: (1) Employer premiums would rise between 5 and 21 billion for plans under congressional consideration. (2) Without offsetting subsidies, these premium increases will cause a transitory increase in unemployment of 0.4-1.4 percentage points. (3) As employer premium payments are shifted to employees, taxable income will fall, leading to additional tax expenditures of 1.3-5.9 billion.

https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/260430,Economic Development in Communist China,84,2,Apr.,1976,"This text is an extension of a previous study, covering the period from the 1930s to 1959, published by the present writer in 1965. The results of the earlier study (amended) are included in the final table. Economic progress was violently interrupted by ""The Year of the Great Leap Forward"" (1958), when, as a result of misinformation about agricultural labor requirements and hysterically falsified statistics, it was claimed that agricultural output was being doubled in 1 year, and that immense transfers of labor to other employments were immediately possible. The result was acute agricultural shortages, indeed famine in 1960-61, and complete disruption of industrial production. Recovery from these disasters took several years. A lesser interruption (to industry but not to agriculture) took place in the ""Cultural Revolution"" of 1966-67. Those to whom the idea of a labor shortage in China appears paradoxical must be reminded that China has few draft animals and still fewer tractors. To cultivate a country the size of China with hand hoes requires several hundred million workers. Chinese population is probably substantially lower than is generally believed, and almost certainly has not been expanding at the rate of 2 percent per year frequently attributed to it. Famine conditions in the early 1960s caused a considerable reduction in the rate of population growth. Publication of Chinese official statistics virtually ceased in 1959, and sources of information for subsequent years are indirect and complex. The basis of the methods used is the construction of estimates of agricultural output and industrial production index numbers, supplemented by information about employment and wages. Almost all attempts hitherto to state China's (and other developing countries') national product in dollar terms give results considerably too low. The yuan has a high purchasing power over services and over some labor-intensive commodities. For a true comparison all Chinese consumption of food should also be revalued at U.S. retail prices. On this basis Chinese 1971 gross product per head, expressed in U.S. dollars of 1974 purchasing power, was 154 for food, 140 for other private consumption, and 157 for investment and government services, or 451 in all. The long-run rate of increase of real gross product per head of population has been about 2 percent per year, whether we take the 1930s or the early 1950s as our starting point. This rate is a little below the general average for developing countries, and much less than is usually claimed. Inequalities in income distribution in China are also not very different from those prevailing in other countries.",Colin Clark,,,,,,

We extend the human capital model to distinguish the investment behavior of age-experience cohorts and to incorporate the effects of calendar time. Several alternative models are developed which are empirically tested based on a unique body of data (on Swedish engineering graduates) reflecting the earnings of cohorts with identical educational qualifications cross-classified by age and experience for a 10-year period. The results clearly indicate the necessity for distinguishing between experience and age in analyses of investment in human capital and are consistent with the interpretation that younger members of the same experience cohort are more efficient in producing human capital. The analysis also indicates the sensitivity of investment profiles to a priori restrictions on functional form and detects an inflection point in earnings increases consistent with Becker's original formulation of human investment theory.,Anders Klevmarken,John M.

An increase in income increases leisure, reduces work in the market, and leaves work at home unchanged.

Similar conclusions emerge from a time-series analysis of the various exchange rates with the implication that a classification of periods according to the degree of turbulence is preferred to a classification based on the legal arrangement (e.g., pegged or floating rates), and (iii) covered interest arbitrage does not seem to entail unexploited opportunities for profits.",Jacob A.

The first model examines life-cycle behavior of investment and health capital when the motive for investing in health is to decrease the probability of illness. In the second model the individual invests in health through his choice of occupation. This determines the extent of his exposure to a pollutant, such as asbestos, which increases the probability of death. The model examines how exposure to pollution should vary with age and predicts how workers should respond to information about occupational dangers.",M. L. Cropper,,,,,,

It is argued that, while higher rates of monetary expansion increase investment and contribute to future consumption, the consequent inflation imposes welfare costs by reducing the level of real balances held by the public. A theoretical framework is developed and its empirical implications considered by deriving the optimal rate of monetary expansion which maximizes the discounted flow of total consumption--material consumption minus the disutility of holding suboptimal levels of real balances--over time.",Bijan B.

Spectral techniques confirm the correlation between long-term interest rates and prices for very long-term swings (the Gibson Paradox), but indicate a significant short cycle correlation only for short-term interest rates, which we term the Kitchin Phenomenon. Past explanations of these correlations have often failed to distinguish cycle lengths and term of interest rates involved. Our analysis rejects Irving Fisher's ""price expectation"" explanation and the Sargent-Wicksell velocity of money explanations. We propose alternative explanations which in part relate to the characteristic behavior of governments during wartime and in part to distributional effects of unanticipated inflation. Our analysis strongly suggests that prior to World War I nominal long and short rates of interest can be regarded as real rates.",Robert J. Shiller,Jeremy J. Siegel,,,,,

Increased inflation uncertainty is assumed to lower the stream of monetary services yielded by a given level of real cash balances. The effects on money demand of such changes in the ""quality"" of money are, in general, theoretically indeterminate. If it is assumed, however, that the monetary service flow is proportional to the real money stock and that the demand for money is interest inelastic, then the predicted relationship between price uncertainty and money demand is unambiguously positive. The empirical findings of this paper, where price uncertainty is operationally measured by the variability of the rate of price change, strongly confirm this positive relationship. These results have important implications for the theory of inflation, the optimum quantity of money, and the potential government tax revenue from money creation.",Benjamin Klein,,,,,,

Because changes in the black share of voters in the post-World War II South are due largely to ""exogenous"" national laws (the Voting Rights Act of 1965, in particular), the paper provides a unique test of the impact of changes in political power on public decision making. The main finding is that increased black voting power appears to have raised demand for black school-teachers in the 1960s. There is additional suggestive evidence that black voting power operated in part through election of black officials. The increase in demand due to the changes in voting offset most of the reduction in demand due to desegregation of schooling in the South, averting the potential dire effects of desegregated education on employment of black teachers. Instead of declining, relative employment of blacks in teaching was maintained, and relative incomes rose in the 1950s and 1960s. These results are consistent with broad ""governmental discrimination"" hypothesis that much of the economic progress or retrogression of blacks in the United States is explicable in terms of black political power and resultant governmental activity.",Richard B.

If there are unemployment or foreign policy externalities, there is an optimal tariff which is proportional to foreign dependence, is inversely proportional to elasticity of external embargo loss, varies directly with embargo probability, and depends more complexly on other parameters.

Although immigrants initially earn less than the native born, their earnings rise more rapidly with U.S. labor market experience, and after 10 to 15 years their earnings equal, and then exceed, that of the native born. Earnings are unrelated to whether the foreign born are U.S. citizens.",Barry R. Chiswick,,,,,,

The relationships determining the optimal wage-ton tax policy of the UMW are estimated over the 1948-73 period. It is found that (1) union members are quite risk averse with a coefficient of relative risk aversion greater than 2.5; (2) union members discount future benefits at the relatively low rate of 3.5-4.5 percent annually; and (3) union members value a dollar spent on fixed fringe benefits almost 40 percent more than a dollar spent on discretionary income. The latter result suggests that the income tax makes nontaxable fringe benefits a relatively attractive method of compensation. Another result which may be important for national energy policy is that the bargaining goals of the UMW are not very responsive to shifts in the demand for coal.",Henry S. Farber,,,,,,

Price level determination is more complicated than output determination, because both anticipated and unanticipated money movements are involved. Empirical results accord well with the model--notably, they support the key hypothesis of a one-to-one, contemporaneous link between anticipated money and the price level. Precise estimates are obtained for the lagged responses of output and prices to unanticipated money movements. Cross-equation comparisons indicate that the price response to unanticipated money movements has a longer lag than the output response.

Even risk-neutral investors require this rate of return as inducement to hold gold in the face of the asymmetric risk of a price collapse.

The implications of this result for the analysis of the efficiency and equity of the current U.S. tax treatment of income from capital are explored. In reducing the real net rate of return, current tax treatment significantly retards capital accumulation. This in turn causes an enormous waste of resources and redistributes a substantial fraction of gross income from labor to capital. Rough estimates of the loss welfare exceed 50 billion per year (a present value close to 1 trillion!) and of the redistribution from labor to capital exceed one-seventh of the capital's share of gross Income.It also suggests that the usual calculations of tax burdens by income class substantially overestimate both the progressivity of the income tax and the alleged regressivity of consumption taxes.",Michael J.

If indexing is costly, indexing provisions will appear only in longer contracts. The proportion of contracts indexed will increase with the variance of monetary disturbances. Finally, monetary variability may cause resource misallocation among industries. Some related policy implications are noted.",Jo Anna Gray,,,,,,
https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/260645,Interest Rate Uncertainty and the Value of Bond Call Protection,86,1,Feb.,1978,"This paper uses a model of the valuation of bonds bearing call options, together with observed market yields on callable bonds, to infer information about the uncertainty associated with interest rate expectations. A dynamic programming solution of the model simultaneously determines both the bond price and the issuer's optimal refunding strategy, given the relevant data describing the bond and the market's expectations of future interest rates. Application of the valuation model in reverse, for quarterly average data for 1969-76, generates a time series representing the uncertainty which the market associated with its expectations of future interest rates during this interval, given the then-prevailing yields on new issues of utility bonds and industrial bonds callable after 5 years and 10 years, respectively. This uncertainty, parameterized as the standard deviation of a truncated normal distribution, fluctuated between 1/2 percent and 3/4 percent between 1969 and early 1974, then rose to sharply higher levels from mid-1974 through mid-1975, and has fluctuated between 3/4 percent and 1 percent since late 1975.",Zvi Bodie,Benjamin M.

Using a multisectoral supply-and-demand framework, the paper goes on to show how changes in relative prices and ultimately the variance of relative price changes are related to supply conditions changes in real income and the amount of unanticipated inflation. The model is used as the basis for an analysis of movements in the prices of consumer goods in the United States for the period 1929-75. The amount of unanticipated inflation (measured as the difference between the actual rate and a time-series predictor) is a more important determinant of relative price variability than the rate of inflation.",Richard W.

Utility depends on the consumption of parents and on the quantity and quality of their children. The income of children is raised when they receive more human and nonhuman capital from their parents. Their income is also raised by their ""endowment"" of genetically determined race, ability, and other characteristics, family reputation and ""connections,"" and knowledge, skills, and goals provided by their family environment. The fortunes of children are linked to their parents not only through investments but also through these endowments acquired from parents (and other family members). The equilibrium income of children is determined by their market and endowed luck, the own income and endowment of parents, and the two parameters, the degree of inheritability and the propensity to invest in children. If these parameters are both less than unity, the distribution of income between families approaches a stationary distribution. The stationary coefficient of variation is greater, the larger the degree of in-heritability and the smaller the propensity to invest in children. Intergenerational mobility measures the effect of a family on the well-being of its children. We show that the family is more important when the degree of inheritability and the propensity to invest are larger. If both these parameters are less than unity, an increase in family income in one generation has negligible effects on the incomes of much later descendants. However, the incomes of children, grandchildren, and other early descendants could significantly increase; indeed, if the sum of these parameters exceeds unity, the changes in income rise for several generations before falling, and the maximum increase in income could exceed the initial increase.",Gary S.

This is because it is preferable to pay workers less than VMP when young and more than VMP when old.

This paper first summarizes 1967-75 wage behavior, showing that relative wages between schooling groups have not changed for prime-aged workers, but there is some evidence, for new job-market entrants, that wages of more educated workers have fallen relative to wages of less educated workers. However, changes among schooling groups are small in comparison to those between new entrants and peak earners within schooling group. The evidence is very direct: as work-experience distributions shifted toward increased proportions of young workers, their relative wages fell. After examining a career-phase model in which workers at different phases are imperfect substitutes, estimates of empirical relationships between cohort size and wages are presented. The main result is that income-depressant effects of (own) cohort size decline over the career but do not vanish altogether. Initial effects include reductions in wage rates and in hours and weeks worked, while persistent effects extend only to wages.",Finis Welch,,,,,,

Male and female wage functions are adjusted for sample censoring to fill out the true population variances and covariances in wages across all families. Due to the larger positive correlation in wages of black spouses, black family earnings would be distributed more unequally even if all individuals worked the same amount. Our labor supply analysis indicates that white families attempt to stabilize family earnings with some family members increasing their labor supply in response to a decline in participation of other family members.

A model of on-the-job training is developed to analyze the determination of the amounts and the sharing of investment in specific human capital. The model predicts that increased profitability of investment leads to an increased bonus-earnings ratio. Evidence indicates that education and firm size, which are often said to be positively associated with the profitability of on-the-job training in Japan, as well as years of experience in the current firm, have significant positive associations with the bonus-earnings ratio. An observed positive association between the cyclical sensitivities in a production index and in the bonus-earnings ratio also supports the theory.",Masanori Hashimoto,,,,,,

Individuals possess labor which they can supply as workers to a competitive labor market or use as entrepreneurs in running a firm. All entrepreneurs have access to the same risky technology and receive all profits from their firms. In the equilibrium, more risk averse individuals become workers while the less risk averse become entrepreneurs. Less risk averse entrepreneurs run larger firms and economy-wide increases in risk aversion reduce the equilibrium wage. A dynamic process of firm entry and exit is stable. The equilibrium is efficient only if all entrepreneurs are risk neutral. Inefficiencies in the number of firms and in the allocation of labor to firms are traced to inefficiencies in the risk allocation caused by institutional constraints on risk trading. In a second best sense which accounts for these constraints, the equilibrium is efficient.",Richard E. Kihlstrom,Jean-Jacques Laffont,,,,,

If a temporary reduction in unemployment causes a permanent increase in inflation, the present value of the resulting future welfare costs may well exceed the temporary short-run gain. Previous analyses have underestimated the cost of a permanent increase in the inflation rate because they have ignored the growth of the economy and therefore the growth of the future instantaneous welfare costs. In the important case in which the growth of aggregate income exceeds the social discount rate, no reduction in unemployment can justify any permanent increase in the rate of inflation. Quite the contrary, if the inflation rate is above its optimal level, the economy should then be deflated to reduce the inflation rate regardless of the temporary consequences for unemployment.",Martin S.

Markets discount widely held factual information very well; this paper studies market efficiency with respect to subjective information. We examine the ""market"" for bets on thoroughbred horse races to determine whether the published forecasts of professional handicappers are completely discounted. A multinomial logit probability model is used to measure the information content of the forecasts, and we find that they do contain considerable information but that the track odds generated by betting discount almost all of it. Within the population of bettors, those betting at the track appear to discount the handicapper information fully, but those betting through New York's off-track betting system do not.",Stephen Figlewski,,,,,,

Some of these are now in use in several states, and one has been recommended by Clifford Donn as an improvement on existing schemes. Under reasonable economic assumptions, two versions of FOA now being used are equivalent to imposing z̄, the settlement the arbitrator would impose in conventional compulsory arbitration would impose in conventional compulsory arbitration, a result contrary to the intent of the FOA statues. However, a simple modification of Donn's proposal leads to a scheme that generates Pareto-efficient settlements that are at least as good for each agent as z̄. This suggests that substantial gains in welfare could be realized by a simple change in existing FOA statues and possibly also by using the new procedure in situations where compulsory arbitration is not now prescribed by law.

This paper offers an explanation for the pattern of commodity price adjustment to monetary change based on differing degrees of price flexibility across industries, where price flexibility is determined by contract length. An extension to product markets of the theory of implicit long-term wage contracts leads to a simple hypothesis which explains the pattern of industry and sectoral price response to monetary change by implicit contract length, the latter being determined by relative price variability. Tests of this hypothesis across broad sectors and industries using postwar U.S. data produce favorable results.

In a simplified linear version, it is shown that the difference between the spot exchange rate and its long-run equilibrium value is proportional to the current level of the trade-balance surplus normalized by the current stock of foreign-asset holdings. Therefore, the analysis provides some evidence in favor of the presumption that surplus country should have an undervalued currency (relative to its long-run level). The basic idea behind the analysis is that, in a world of high capital mobility,current flow payments disequilibria can be accommodated by capital flows without need, in principle, for exchange rate movements. Only if the public expects lasting change in the required rate of capital flows will exchange rates adjust, since in this case the expected time path of net foreign assets will be significantly affected.",Carlos Alfredo Rodríguez,,,,,,

As is conventional in the general equilibrium tax literature, corporate and property taxes are treated as ad volorem taxes on capital use by industry and social security taxes as ad valorem taxes on labor use by industry. National accounts sources are used both to obtain model equivalent tax rates by trading area and to construct a benchmark data set with which to estimate the model. Results suggest that under some assumptions current factor tax structures can produce significant terms-of-trade gains, and in the U.S. case results show welfare losses occurring from the removal of existing distortions. This result contrasts with conventional closed economy analysis of distorting factor trades and is explained by national terms-of-trade losses which more than outweigh the gains from removal of domestic distortions.

I show that demand uncertainty has no effect on the expected dynamics of market price, while reserve uncertainty shifts the expected rate of change of price only if extraction costs are nonlinear in reserves. However, if the demand function is nonlinear, both demand, and reserve uncertainty affect the dynamics of production, whatever the character of extraction costs.

Exogenous, uncertain changes in the expected return to capital assets relative to money holding are shown to induce revisions in investors' desired portfolios. Under a passive policy, asset market equilibrium requires a change in the value of money, which, if imperfectly perceived, detracts from the signaling aspect of observed prices. Active money growth feedback rules are examined as altering the prospective return to money holding. A policy may be designed to maintain the relative attractiveness between real capital and money even if the controlling authority has no informational advantage.

A contract multiplier causes business cycles to persist beyond the length of the longest contract, and a diffusion of shocks across contracts causes the persistence to increase for several periods before diminishing. A persistence of inflation is also generated by the contracts. This persistence is represented as a reduced-form distributed-lag wage equation in which the lag coefficients have a pure-expectations component and an inertia component due to the overhang of outstanding contracts.

Such a process does not have the basic property of money which we call ""process consistency,"" and we suggest that agents' subjective probabilities that their money is ""process consistent"" are identical to the probability that they attach to a currency reform.

Thus, Hand's judgment appears sound. Puzzle 2: Is it in Alcoa's own interests to suppress recycling of scrap aluminum if feasible?

The analysis is then used to derive the optimal hedging for representative cocoa producers of Ghana, Nigeria, Ivory Coast, and Brazil, four countries which account for close to 80 percent of world production. While the traditional definition of hedging recommends a hedge ratio of one, this paper shows that the ratio of optimal hedge to expected output should be below unity. To arrive at this result, individual preferences are represented by a logarithmic utility function (and also by a quadratic utility function for values of the risk parameter which are inferior to 0.001). Thus, limited usage of the futures market may be superior to a full short hedge of expected output when there is production variability. This result is a warning for developing countries whose agricultural produce is subject to high price and quantity volatility and should aid them in deciding upon the use of futures trading as a hedging instrument.",Jacques Rolfo,,,,,,

Flexibility of the real exchange rate and industrial output responses to demand are the main adjustment mechanisms. The key to understanding the behavior of the Brazilian economy in 1930s is the government coffee-support policy which held the income of the export sector at a high level and hence enabled the manufacturing sector to expand. The fact that industrial output expanded in the face of both real depreciation and appreciation points to the importance of expenditure effects relative to price effects during the 1930s.,Eliana A.

Second, those studies all omit the energy opportunity costs of nonenergy inputs (e.g., the fuel substituted elsewhere for the labor used to produce energy).

Differences in inherited wealth resulting from unequal parental incomes increase inequality in recipients' consumption. However, unequal bequests caused by differences among families in the endowed ability of children or the costs of producing human capital are equalizing. Empirical results confirm these predictions: The inheritance received by children is inversely related to both children's income and parental education.

As countries become more similar, the trade between them will increasingly become intraindustry in character. Second, the effects of opening trade depend on its type. If intraindustry trade is sufficiently dominant, the advantages of extending the market will outweigh the distributional effects, and the owners of scarce as well as of abundant factors will be better off.",Paul R.

Increased price is shown to be a means of assuring contractual performance. A necessary and sufficient condition for performance is the existence of price sufficiently above salvageable production costs so that the nonperforming firm loses a discounted steam of rents on future sales which is greater than the wealth increase from nonperformance. This will generally imply a market price greater than the perfectly competitive price and rationalize investments in firm-specific assets.

These profiles are simply too flat to generate substantial life-cycle savings.

Analysis of two collections of contracts made in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries supports the prediction. Age, skill, and literacy were negatively related to length of indenture.

In dynamic contexts, a proper definition of people's constraints includes among them laws of motion that describe the evolution of the taxes they must pay and the prices of the goods that they buy and sell. Changes in agents' perceptions of these laws of motion (or constraints) will in general produce changes in the schedules that describe the choices they make as a function of the information that they possess. Until very recently, received dynamic econometric practice ignored this principle. The practice of dynamic econometrics should be changed so that it is consistent with the principle that people's rules of choice are influenced by their constraints. This is a substantial undertaking and involves major adjustments in the ways that we formulate, estimate, and simulate econometric models.",Thomas J. Sargent,,,,,,

Both functions have required a complex rate structure to enforce the respective forms of price discrimination. Using a sample of freight bills from motor carriers and railroads, this paper demonstrates that the principal result of motor carrier regulation has been to maintain a cartel of truckers, while railroad regulation has thwarted the wishes of the railroad cartel by imposing equalizing discrimination on weak and strong shippers. Motor carrier rates respond in an economically rational manner to costs and shipper bargaining power; rail rates are either unresponsive or perversely responsive to the same factors.

This paper offers new empirical estimates of this difference and finds it to be quite substantial. The analysis is based on an amendment of the standard distributed lag version of the permanent income hypothesis that distinguishes temporary taxes from other income on the grounds that the former are ""more transitory."" This amendment, which is broadly consistent with rational expectations, leads to a nonlinear consumption function. Though the standard error is unavoidably large, the point estimate suggests that a temporary tax change is treated as a 50-50 blend of a normal income tax change and a pure windfall. Over a 1-year planning horizon, a temporary tax change is estimated to have only a little more than half the impact of a permanent tax change of equal magnitude, and a rebate is estimated to have only about 38 percent of the impact.",Alan S.

Our particular concern is with tests using short-run measures of dividend yield--that is, measures that seek to deduce the differential tax burden on dividends over long-term capital gains from differences in rates of return on shares that do not pay a cash dividend during the return interval. We show that such measures are inappropriate for that purpose. Any yield-related effects associated with such measures must arise from sources other than the long-term tax differential.

Results show that these differences are explained by the fact that men may be more able to substitute home for market medical care. Men may also have a lower return to the prior use of medical care because men are more likely to suffer from causes against which medical care is not effective. Potential differences in the value of time do not account for the differences in utilization of medical care.",Jody L. Sindelar,,,,,,

Mobility is the outgrowth of a prior investment decision. In particular, we focus on the human capital (i.e., training) decisions of workers. Uncertainty isa critical feature in such training decisions. The acquisition of general (vs. specific) skills allows a worker to select the more favorable sector after uncertainty is resolved. Thus general training has option value, which is enhanced by increases in risk. General training is a form of self-insurance. We study the impact of conventional insurance opportunities on training decisions. We find that the availabilty of income insurance does not necessarily imply less mobile workers.",Gene M.

The methodology uses the adult wage structure which exists prior to a change in the federal minimum wage to identify the members of the subminimum wage population. This allows the parameterization of the disemployment effects of the minimum wage amendment on the subminimum population and the spillover employment effects on the above-minimum population. The members of the subminimum population are found to experience considerably reduced employment probabilities and annual hours worked (conditional on employment). Some evidence of above-minimum spillover effects is also found. The paper evaluates the impact of the minimum on the earnings distribution and concludes that the burden of the minimum wage falls most severely on females. This effect on adult females is surprisingly neutral with respect to race. The greatest beneficiaries of the minimum among the adult population are union members.

High inflation does not necessarily promote an increase in the capital stock--the Mundell-Tobin effect is absent. The policy conclusion is standard: deflate at the rate of time preference.

The paper analyzes the costs and benefits of using a local currency, with emphasis on the seigniorage foregone by using a foreign money. Even if it should be desirable for a country to fix its exchange rate, it still loses seigniorage if it does not use its own money. The case for using a foreign money then turns largely on the superior discipline imposed on domestic policymakers by removing their control over the money supply. Alternative methods of imposing discipline are discussed. Estimates of the amount of seigniorage raised by different governments are presented; seigniorage amounts in some cases to about 10 percent of government revenue. Estimates are also presented of both the annual flow and one-time stock costs of giving up use of domestic currencies and instead using the dollar.

A reverse Averch-Johnson result--that monopolist sellers may invest less in fixed costs (including plant modernization and research and development) than would the renters--is shown.

Here exchange-rate indexation works to amplify the effect of wage disturbances on prices and potentially on output. In the context of a rational-expectations model with long-term overlapping wage contracts, the analysis shows that the impact of increased indexation on output and price-level stability depends on the extent of monetary accommodation.",Rudiger Dornbusch,,,,,,

It is demonstrated that the volatility of the asset's price uniformly violates the theoretical upper bound implied by the present value relation. In addition, the variance bounds may be violated by a significant margin at the same time the asset's price is almost a random walk.

This paper shows that in small samples the ""volatility"" or ""variance-bounds"" tests tend to be biased, often severely, toward rejection of the null hypothesis of market efficiency. Thus the apparent violation of market efficiency may be reflecting the sampling properties of the volatility measures, rather than a failure of the market efficiency hypothesis itself.

The equilibrium time series of these models can display interesting movement in response to shocks and measurement errors, including persistence, certain cross-correlation properties, and damped oscillations. That is, forecasts errors are serially correlated over decision makers and serially correlated over time in a certain crucial sense.

Then, we find that (1) the rates of monetary growth and inflation are excessive; (2) these rates depend on the slope of Phillips curve, the natural unemployment rate, and other variables that affect the benefits and costs from inflation; (3) the monetary authority behaves countercyclically; and (4) unemployment is independent of money policy.

In fact, most of the modern literature concerned with capital-theoretic problems represents preferences by a functional in which an additive utility function is discounted by a constant rate of time preference. This specification is attractive because it is analytically tractable in dynamic models, and it clearly delineates how tastes and opportunities interact to determine an economy's (household's) paths of consumption and capital formation. However, its rigid structure (constancy of time preference) severely limits the conclusions and explanatory power of the corresponding models. This paper considers a class of utility functionals (in continuous time) which have the appealing feature that the rate of time preference depends systematically on an index of aggregate future consumption. The more flexible structure embodied in these functionals leads to important generalizations and modifications of standard conclusions. We highlight this added richness by examining five basic problems in dynamic economic analysis.",Larry G. Epstein,J. Allan Hynes,,,,,

Individuals know that they will be charged for the positions to which they are assigned. A set of prices that provide no incentive for the individual to misrepresent his preferences is suggested. It is shown that these prices constitute an element of the optimal solution to the dual of a linear programming assignment problem. Both the optimal allocation and the prices to be charged can be derived by solving two linear programming problems once preferences have been elicited. The procedure can usefully be viewed as a simulation of a competitive market under conditions where such a market cannot be expected to function well. It results in an efficient allocation where all resources are valued at their opportunity costs and ""consumer surplus"" is maximized; its outcome thus has the desirable properties of competitive market equilibria.",Herman B.

This does not mean that oil shocks caused these recessions. Evidence is presented, however, that even over the period 1948-72 this correlation is statistically significant and nonspurious, supporting the proposition that oil shocks were a contributing factor in at least some of the U.S. recessions prior to 1972.

In the presence of monetary and real stochastic disturbances the stability of the levels of employment and output hinges on the nature of the wage contracts.

We demonstrate that when the payoffs of the policy are correlated with the payoffs to the individual's other assets, the demand for insurance contracts is generally not a separable portfolio decision. We argue that this separability condition is not generally met because of significant interdependence of claims across different insurance policies.

But are perceived tax prices systematically and persistently reduced by separation? Although in stock markets all agents' expectations may be unbiased, they may or may not be unbiased in political markets. This paper analyzes the separation created in federal states when the central government finances local expenditures. Evidence from a dynamic decisive-voter model is presented that indicates that the separation introduced by federal grants to Canadian provinces did in fact reduce the perceived tax price of provincial public services and raise provincial expenditures. The results suggest also that the effect of separation diminished over time.",Stanley L. Winer,,,,,,

The paper shows how transitory disturbances in output or in the world real interest rate affect the time profile of consumption and the trade balance.

In such instances, which are fairly common, we find that the classic Hotelling rule for competitive extraction does not apply, since competitive price equilibria generally do not exist. This is in marked contrast to static markets where the usual textbook example of firms with U-shaped average cost curves is not inconsistent with the existence of competitive equilibria. Furthermore, oligopolistic market equilibria in which resource firms act as Nash producers may also fail to exist when there are returns to scale in production.",Mukesh Eswaran,Tracy R.

The resulting estimates indicate that consumers took the energy crises seriously and formed expectations about future gasoline prices that appear rational when compared with the historical gasoline price series, with the forecasts of specialists and experts, or with the actual postsample behavior of gasoline prices.

https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/261255,Job Matching with Finite Horizon and Risk Aversion,92,4,Aug.,1984,"The consequences of introducing risk-averse workers with a known, finite retirement age into a simple job-matching framework are explored. The job-matching model includes two jobs. In the ""primary"" job, workers and firms learn about the worker's productivity by observing his output over time. In the ""secondary"" job, productivity of any worker is known with certainty at the outset. Workers start off in the primary job but, based on their observed performance, may choose to switch to the secondary job. The model is developed in two stages. First, the finite retirement age is introduced while the usual assumption of risk-neutral workers is retained. In this model it is shown that all workers who achieve at least a certain cumulative output record, denoted r*, by a certain age, denoted T, will thereafter remain in the primary job until retirement. Those who do not achieve r* by age T switch to the secondary job at or before age T and remain there. Second, risk aversion is introduced along with finite retirement age. Here the turnover aspects of the equilibrium are similar to the risk-neutral case, but firms provide workers with wage insurance. This takes the form of wages that are downward rigid. As a result, it may be optimal ex ante for workers to delegate the job choice decision to the employer, and, ex post, not all separations will be voluntary for the work r.",Milton Harris,Yoram Weiss,,,,,

Without a consensus as to reasonable empirical specifications, tests of the hypotheses remain minimal or controversial. In this study we examine the efficiency of experimental asset markets in which one may unambiguously identify the public and private information sets of traders. We focus on how market efficiency is affected by the presence of futures markets in settings that incorporate different types of uncertainty and inside information. Our experimental results support four conclusions: (1) market outcomes tend to evolve toward strong-form informationally efficient equilibria, whether or not futures markets and/or event uncertainty are present; (2) the presence of futures markets clearly stabilizes spot prices; (3) the presence of futures markets tends to speed the evolution of asset markets to more efficient equilibria where there is event uncertainty; and (4) futures markets promote the ""leakage"" of inside information, with strong-form predictions outperforming semi-strong-form predictions.",Daniel Friedman,Glenn W.

Nevertheless, such advertising may indirectly signal quality if there exist market mechanisms that produce a positive relationship between product quality and advertising expenditures. Two models of this phenomenon are presented. In each, advertising signals quality in the short run. The models differ in their treatment of the effect of advertising on long-run sales. In the first, all high-quality firms ultimately establish reputations for high quality whether they advertise or not. This is shown to imply that advertising can signal quality if and only if high-quality production requires investments in specialized assets that increase fixed costs but not marginal costs. In the second model, where nonadvertising firms never acquire a reputation for high quality, advertising might signal quality even if marginal production costs are somewhat lower for low quality. These conclusions closely parallel arguments previously made by Phillip Nelson.",Richard E. Kihlstrom,Michael H. Riordan,,,,,

When the product is undifferentiated, advertising conveys information about price. The standard intuition suggests that such prohibitions will raise buyer search costs, making demand less elastic. This raises price and profits in an industry. Advertising restrictions provide an indirect means of coordinating pricing strategies in this framework. Here we consider the cost side of the same argument. The efficiency of firms in an industry is allowed to vary and information about costs is private. In this environment efficient firms are hurt by advertising restrictions, since lower advertised prices constitute their most effective competitive weapon. We show that when the number of buyers and sellers is finite, there is a nonzero probability that advertising restrictions will reduce every firm's price. This occurs when all firms are more efficient than their competitors expect them to be. Further, when the number of buyers and sellers is infinite, it is possible that average price charged in an industry can fall after a ban on advertising.",Michael Peters,,,,,,

The analysis uses a simulation methodology in which only the labor supply effects are evaluated; other behavioral effects are ignored. The most striking finding is that marginal cost is quite high even for modest labor supply elasticities. For example, in the benchmark case with a weighted-average economy-wide uncompensated wage elasticity of 0.2 (and compensated elasticity of 0.31), the disposable money income of upper-income quintiles of households is depressed by 9.51 for each dollar increase in the disposable money income of lower-income quintiles.

Because of this result, we apply the theory in the setting of college basketball.

Two recent studies have left the impression that the transitional losses would be large. Using a life-cycle growth model, this paper examines two reasons why these studies have probably overestimated the transitional losses. The model computes the welfare gains and losses of each age cohort along the transition path. It is shown that the greater the bequest motive and subjective discount rate generating the particular initial income tax steady state, the smaller would be the transitional losses. Similarly, a policy of age phasing would reduce the losses. The results demonstrate the importance of examining the transition path whenever a policy change alters capital accumulation.",Laurence S.

Purchasing-power parity is assumed to hold at the aggregate level. However, because of local deviations from purchasing-power parity, agents possess differential information. Using this framework, it is shown that when the exchange rate is flexible monetary policy can influence the distribution of real output by altering the information content of the exchange rate. However, when monetary policy is committed to fixing the exchange rate (by a feedback rule) the distribution of real output is independent of the particular exchange rate rule chosen. The stability of real output under the two regimes is compared, and it is demonstrated that regardless of the stability of domestic monetary policy a flexible exchange rate regime is superior in this respect. Possible qualifications and extensions of these results are also discussed.",Kent P. Kimbrough,,,,,,

These same factors remain important in a two-good version with Heckscher-Ohlin production structure. In this case, the direction of physical capital flow is determinate (unlike in a world of certainty) and may hinge on the identity of the factor that is used intensively in the industry with random technology.",Gene M.

The farmer's decision consists of specifying each period the portion of his land to be devoted to the growing of alternative crops. The dynamic element in the farmer's problem comes from the technology. A quadratic production technology is used. The farmer's optimal land allocation decision rules are derived as linear functions of past land allocations, expectations of future product prices, and other exogenous variables; and they can be interpreted as an optimal crop rotation. Assuming rational expectations and the exogeneity of prices for a small open economy, one obtains closed-form linear regression equations representing decision rules and stochastic processes.

A model of human capital investment is used to analyze differences among cohorts in the life-cycle profile of the variance of log earnings. It is shown that a pattern of sharply increasing and then declining labor force growth rates will tend to raise the return on human capital investment and thereby increase the variance of postschooling investment and log earnings early in the life cycle. This positive effect on relative earnings inequality should decline with experience and possibly become negative. Because of the post-World War II baby boom and baby bust, recent labor force entrants have faced just such a pattern of actual and projected labor force growth rates during their work life.

The question is studied in a discrete-time, perfect-foresight version of the competitive equilibrium model of Sidrauski, modified by the inclusion of government bonds as a third asset. It is shown that the monetarist hypothesis is invalid if the deficit is defined exclusive of interest payments, but that it is valid under the conventional definition. It is also shown that the stock of bonds can grow indefinitely at a rate in excess of the rate of output growth, provided that the difference is less than the rate of time preference.

The purposes of this paper are to develop an overlapping generations model that gives money a medium of exchange role and that is consistent with the evidence and to point out the crucial role of the assumptions made in earlier models about the interaction of monetary and fiscal policy and about the supply-side effects of open market operations.       ,Douglas G.

https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/261359,A Model of Declining Health and Retirement,93,6,Dec.,1985,"   The declining U.S. average retirement age has been difficult to reconcile with cross-section evidence that poor health is a primary cause of early retirement. This paper reconciles those observations by building a Grossman-type model of investment in health, distinguished from its predecessor by a more formal treatment of initial conditions. A discontinuous mid-life increase in health investment (retirement) is shown, in general, to be part of the optimal investment strategy. Time-series productivity increases are shown to lower the optimal retirement age, while varying health endowments and depreciation rates are shown to be able to account for cross-section rement age variations.

The analysis reveals that the feasible range of regulation is restricted by the same forces that block private agreement. The focus of the study is oil field unitization regulation in Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming (federal lands) from 1948 through 1975. Despite large potential gains from unitization, private negotiations fail because of lease heterogeneities and information problems regarding lease value estimates. In response, the federal and state governments have adopted strikingly different policies to encourage unitization with different results. Only the federal government’s regulations are effective because they surmount information problems. Texas has the least successful regulation.

As a result a redistribution of income at the expense of the upper income class yields a constant or an increased savings ratio developing on whether such a redistribution includes the lower income class or not.",Yiannis P.

Strong efficiencyimplies that employment is set so as to equate the marginal revenue product of workers to their alternative wage. It follows that employment in such contracts fluctuates with the determinants of a worker's marginal revenue product and with the worker's alternative wage, but not with the observed contract wage. We have examined two kinds of evidence to test the strong efficiency hypothesis. Laboratory experiments by Siegel et al. indicate that this hypothesis is strongly confirmed when the bargaining parties are required to agree on price and quantity simultaneously and is strongly rejected when the parties are required to bargain by a system of price leadership. In our field data on the printing trades, we find no convincing evidence of strong efficiency. We have also examined the evidence in support of what we have called the ""weak efficiency hypothesis."" According to this hypothesis, both the contract wage and the alternative wage determine employment. We have found only mixed support for this hypothesis because our measures of the alternative wage available to workers are frequently positively related to employment, precisely the contrary to the hypothesized direction of this effect in a weakly efficient contract.",James N.

The theoretical context is a dynamic spatial equilibrium among locales that is supported by incentives to migrate to markets offering the greatest present value of future earnings. Thus costly migration arbitrages geographic wage differences. Using a time series of cross-sectional files from the Current Population Surveys of 1977-79, I find that wages are sensitive to interarea differences in market conditions. A positive relative shock to local labor demand increases relative wages within a locale, but expectations of future demand actually reduce current wages because of increased current migration. Thus wages are more flexible in response to transitory changes in local market conditions than to permanent ones. Consistent with theory, wages are most flexible among the least mobile demographic groups, who are inelastically supplied across geographic areas.",Robert H. Topel,,,,,,

The Census Bureau has dealt with this problem, which has been increasing in severity over time, by imputing incomes of non-respondents. Their imputation procedure, called the ""hot deck,"" essentially matches nonrespondents with demographically similar donors. In this paper we evaluate the census imputation methodology and raise some questions. First, the census procedure is tied to commonality of events in the population rather than the more appropriate informational content of regressors. Clearly, the census procedure severely understates income in certain occupations. Because it is based on the apparently invalid assumption that income does not affect reporting propensities, it most likely understates average incomes as well.",Lee Lillard,James P.

Implications are that market forces that would work naturally to induce migration from low-to high-income regions (and thus equalize earned incomes) have been short-circuited and that traditional tools of manpower policy for influencing migration, such as job creation, skill enhancement, or wages, are less effective currently than they might have been in the past.",R.

Williamson's underinvestment presumption is shown to hold under very general assumptions about bargaining and about the ex post asymmetry of information as long as the firm's investment is not observable by the sponsor. The introduction of a cancellation fee may well lead to even less investment contrary to what is sometimes argued.

The exercise shows a highly significant effect of caloric intake on labor productivity, providing solid support for the nutrition-productivity hypothesis.

When categorization is costless, we demonstrate that government, having no better information than market participants, can effect redistribution without assuming dictatorial control of the market, implying that a market equilibrium with costless categorization is potentially Pareto superior to one without it.

https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/261509,Labor Rent Sharing and Regulation: Evidence from the Trucking Industry,95,6,Dec.,1987,"     Labor is likely to be an important claimant to firms’ rents, parti ularly in a regulated environment. This study analyzes wage responses to trucking deregulation to test labor rent-sharing hypotheses. The results indicate substantial declines in union wages as a consequence of reduced regulatory rents. Union premia over nonunion wages fell from 50 percent to less than 30 percent, implying aggregate annual losses of $950 million to $1.6 billion. Rent pillovers to nonunion drivers and truck drivers outside the regulated trucking industry appear insignificant. The results suggest that union workers captured more than two-thirds of total industry rents and provide strong support for union rent-sharing hypotheses.               ",Nancy L. Rose,,,,,,2.0

Traditional cost-of-living indices assume that the consumer passively accepts prices as given. We begin by deriving a multiprice search model in which the consumer chooses the search strategy that minimizes the expected cost of buying a given level of utility. In contrast to existing search models, our search model allows the consumer to change the allocation of expenditures among goods as information about prices changes and enables us to construct a cost-of-living index for an agent who searches across distributions of offer prices. Unlike traditional cost-of-living measures that ignore search behavior, the searcher's cost-of-living index depends on search costs. This index is compared with those of consumers who shop randomly and also those who enjoy perfect information, and some bounding results are presented.                  ",Paul M. Anglin,Michael R.

First, I derive the crucial formulas for the excess burden of anticipated and unanticipated, temporary and permanent, tax changes. Second, I derive closed-form expressions for the excess burdens when tax rates are low. Third, using a range of estimates for taste and technology parameters suggested by the empirical literature, I compute various examples and find that excess burdens are larger than indicated by previous studies that use alternative models, very sensitive to parameter estimates, and equally sensitive to anticipation effects. However, the rankings of alternative tax policies turn out to be insensitive to these estimates. Both the analytical computations and the computed examples indicate that delay increases the cost of capital income taxation but tends to reduce the efficiency cost of wage taxation. Furthermore, immediate and temporary investment tax credits are always self-financing, and an investment tax credit at a future time dominates a capital income tax cut at that time. Generally, the timing and anticipated duration of any tax policy are as important as the technical and taste parameters in determining its efficacy.                ",Kenneth L. Judd,,,,,,2.0

This distinction is made operational with the aid of the NBER-ASA survey data on matched point and probabilistic forecasts of inflation and the rate of change in gross national product. The means of the two sets of forecasts agree closely. Standard deviations of point forecasts tend to understate uncertainty as measured by standard deviations of the predictive probability distributions. However, these measures of consensus and uncertainty are on the whole positively correlated. There is evidence that expectations of higher inflation generate greater uncertainty about inflation. Tests also favor the hypothesis that a rise in inflation uncertainty has adverse effects on real growth. ",Victor Zarnowitz,Louis A. Lambros,,,,,2.0

Efficiency is shown to depend on the price elasticity of private spending and the trade-off between public and private spending. When this trade-off is dollar for dollar, however, a subsidy is always more efficient than direct taxation. The gains from a subsidy are larger for a mixed good than for a pure public good. Looking at distributional effects, 1 show when richer taxpayers may prefer a tax credit to deductibility, even though they face lower prices with deductibility. I also show when richer taxpayers prefer direct taxation to either type of subsidy.         ",Russell D. Roberts,,,,,,2.0

Formally, they purport to measure the change in the cost of attaining a certain welfare level when the family composition varies. This paper shows that the definition and the measurement of these scales depend crucially on the concept of welfare used. When welfare is the utility parents derive from their own consumption, one has to assume separability of parents' and children's consumption. This assumption implies that the only way of imputing the intrafamily allocation of resources is by observing the consumption patterns of adult goods. Regardless of the definition used, one cannot separate the factors reflecting home technology (i.e., ""needs"") from those determining the intrafamily distribution rule (i.e., ""wants"") out of consumption data.",Reuben Gronau,,,,,,

For a commodity that is subject to output shocks, processors tend to hedge long, in contrast with Hick's theory of futures hedging. Nevertheless, if transaction costs are low, the two-stage production process brings about a downward futures price bias, consistent with Hick's pricing prediction. But if costs of trading futures are high, growers tend to be differentially driven from the futures market, reversing the direction of the bias. Futures trading may also affect the organization of industry; when demand is inelastic, futures trading can serve as a substitute for vertical integration as a means of diversifying risk because the risk positions of growers are complementary with those of processors.",David Hirshleifer,,,,,,

We provide new evidence on this question by examining the possible bias that arises when (1) workers have unobserved characteristics that affect their wages and (2) those workers who move in and out of the work force over the cycle have unobserved characteristics systematically different from those who stay in. We distinguish as well between the bias that arises from those unobserved characteristics that are permanent components of wages and those that are transitory. We utilize micro, panel data, and maximum likelihood selectivity bias techniques to estimate both the extent of this selectivity-cum-aggregation bias and the true effect of the cycle on real wages. We find that selectivity bias is present: workers are more likely to lose employment during a recession if they have high wages, especially if they have a high transitory wage component. Overall, the effect of selectivity is to bias ordinary least squares estimates based only on workers in a procyclical direction. Our results show that the true effect of the cycle on wages is still procyclical but much smaller in magnitude than previous estimates using micro data have suggested.",Michael Keane,Robert Moffitt,David Runkle,,,,

If union goods are heterogeneous in labor intensity, the introduction of an active union in the domestic country causes only the least labor-intensive range of union goods to be produced there, with goods of greatest labor intensity produced abroad because of the relatively high cost of domestic union labor. A narrowing of the scope of domestic union production will eliminate relatively labor-intensive goods, leading a rent-maximizing union to raise its union premium. The implications of this union behavior for comparative statics results are considered.",Robert W. Staiger,,,,,,

This paper develops a theoretical model of intergenerational transfers incorporating time use. With the aid of time budget and consumer expenditure surveys, empirical estimates of the age profiles of various types of time and goods consumption are presented, and we conclude that (1) the net direction of intergenerational transfers is from younger to older ages; (2) under the golden-rule assumption, these transfers largely constitute an externality to childbearing; and (3) they are not large enough to offset the capital dilution effect that would result from higher fertility and more rapid population growth.",Ronald D.

In this paper, we critique the assumptions on which the dynastic model is predicated and argue that this framework is not a suitable abstraction in contexts in which the objective is to analyze the effects of public policies. We reach this conclusion by formally considering a world in which each generation consists of a large number of distinct individuals as opposed to one representative individual. We point out that family linkages form complex networks, in which each individual may belong to many dynastic groupings. The resulting proliferation of linkages between families gives rise to a host of neutrality results, including the irrelevance of all public redistributions, distortionary taxes, and prices. Since these results are not at all descriptive of the real world, we conclude that, in some fundamental sense, the world is not even approximately dynastic.

Most theoretical explanations for the existence of backwardation are quite restrictive. Among the assumptions are pure forward as opposed to true futures trading, differences in probability beliefs, degrees of risk aversion, or the level of commodity commitments among long and short hedgers. In a simple model of short and long commodity hedgers, we show that a backwardation equilibrium can occur in a true futures (as opposed to forward) market even when hedgers are identical in these respects and speculators hold the same probability beliefs as hedgers. This result is driven by Houthakker's completely neglected intuitive notion that one possible explanation for backwardation is the high correlation between cash and futures prices when inventories of a commodity are large. While the simple existence of such an ""inventory effect"" does not necessarily imply backwardation, we prove that backwardation will occur under an appropriately specified inventory effect.",Rodney Fort,James Quirk,,,,,

It is found that the conditional covariances are quite variable over time and are a significant determinant of time-varying risk premia. The implied betas are also time-varying and forecastable. However, there is evidence that other variables including innovations in consumption should also be considered in the investor's information set when estimating the conditional distribution of returns.",Tim Bollerslev,Robert F.

Under a mild further restriction, optimal no-falsification contracts are, in addition, piece-wise linear. Optimal contracts may in general require falsifying the state, but for a set of the highest endowment realizations there is no falsification.

Furthermore, it is shown that introducing a secondary market for a rationed good does not necessarily improve welfare because total surplus under rationing by waiting depends more on the variance than on the level of time costs and personal valuations.

Analysis of longitudinal South Indian village data lends support to the hypothesis. Marriage cum migration contributes significantly to a reduction in the variability of household food consumption. Farm households afflicted with more variable profits tend to engage in longer-distance marriage cum migration.

The timing of the seasonal fluctuations consists of increases in the second and fourth quarters, a large decrease in the first quarter, and a mild decrease in the third quarter. The paper demonstrates that, with respect to each of several major stylized facts about business cycles, the seasonal cycle displays the same characteristics as the business cycle, in some cases even more dramatically than the business cycle. That is, we find that at seasonal frequencies as well as at business cycle frequencies, output movements across broadly defined sectors move together, the timing of production and the timing of sales coincide closely, labor productivity is procyclical, nominal money and real output are highly correlated, and prices vary less than quantities. There is a ""seasonal business cycle"" in the U.S. economy, and its characteristics closely mirror those of the conventional business cycle.",Robert B. Barsky,Jeffrey A. Miron,,,,,

Relative comparisons imply that some reference group must be selected. The major result is that within the relevant groups, some wage compression is efficient.",Edward P. Lazear,,,,,,

We show that these differentials arise in markets with consumer discrimination and incomplete information about the price of the good and the race of the seller. Equilibrium income distributions have two properties: mean black incomes are lower than mean white incomes, and the returns to ability are lower for black than for white sellers. Able blacks, therefore, are less likely to self-select into the self-employment sector than able whites. Using the 1980 census data, we find that observed racial differences in the self-employment income distributions are consistent with the theoretical predictions.",George J. Borjas,Stephen G.

Contemporary nonlibertarian political philosophers, such as John Rawls and Ronald Dworkin, achieve their relatively egalitarian conclusion by effectively denying self-ownership as a premise. An alternative challenge to liberalism, which does not take the radical starting point of denying self-ownership, is to declare that while certain rights to benefit by virtue of superior skill should be protected (a degree of self-ownership), productive assets in the external world be viewed as publicly owned and not privately appropriable. What allocation mechanisms on a space of possible economies satisfy axioms that are necessary to guarantee both private ownership of self and public or joint ownership of the external world? We propose an axiomatic method for modeling problems in political philosophy of this sort and answer the question posed for a simple model.

A self-enforcing contract, however, can be sustained only in a repeated game. In the fall of 1958, the right to withdraw from a collective was deprived.

We work within a calibrated, two-sector endogenous growth model, which has its origins in the microeconomic literature on human capital formation. We show that national taxation can substantially affect long-run growth rates. In particular, for small open economies with substantial capital mobility, national taxation can readily lead to ""development traps"" (in which countries stagnate or regress) or to ""growth miracles"" (in which countries shift from little growth to rapid expansion). This influence of taxation on the rate of economic growth has important welfare implications: in basic endogenous growth models, the welfare cost of a 10 percent increase in the rate of income tax can be 40 times larger than in the basic neoclassical model.",Robert G.

We first calculate effective tax rates on income from capital employed in corporate, noncorporate, and household sectors. We then project the future growth of the U.S. economy with and without the 1986 tax reform. We find that much of the potential gain in welfare was dissipated through failure to index the income tax base for inflation. The most promising avenue for future reform is to include income from household assets in the tax base, while reducing tax rates on business income.",Dale W. Jorgenson,Kun-Young Yun,,,,,

This allocation is heavily influenced by the relative payoffs society offers to such activities.

The unpredictability of noise traders' beliefs creates a risk in the price of the asset that deters rational arbitrageurs from aggressively betting against them. As a result, prices can diverge significantly from fundamental values even in the absence of fundamental risk. Moreover, bearing a disproportionate amount of risk that they themselves create enables noise traders to earn a higher expected return than rational investors do.

Our comparative dynamics predictions indicate that optimal health and longevity are increasing functions of endowed wealth rather than, necessarily, current income; that improvements in opportunities to produce health can accentuate the differences between endowed health and attained longevity levels; and that the value individuals ascribe to their health may be increasing over a good portion of their life cycle.

I resolve Deaton's paradox by providing decompositions of labor income into permanent and transitory components. These preserve the univariate dynamic properties of labor income.

The key features distinguishing such hazards are the long temporal separation between exposure to a hazard and disease and the large damages when injuries finally emerge. The large scale of damages creates a strong incentive to avoid liability payments, and the long temporal separation creates numerous avenues through which parties can avoid paying possible damage awards. The analysis focuses on the incentive to avoid paying damages by vertically divesting production tasks associated with serious occupational risks. Such divestiture can lower liability costs if the small firm operating the risky stage goes out of business before latent injuries emerge or has insufficient assets to pay damages and declares bankruptcy when suits are filed. The paper then presents an empirical regression analysis of small-firm entry into the U.S. economy between 1967 and 1980, the period in which liability laws were changing. The point estimate is that, ceteris paribus, liability changes appear to have led to a large increase in small corporations in hazardous sectors. Hence the empirical analysis shows widespread attempts to avoid liability by shielding assets through divestiture.",Al H. Ringleb,Steven N. Wiggins,,,,,

The empirical analysis focuses on differences in search behavior between the employed and unemployed. A key finding of the analysis is that the offer rate per contact is greater for employed searchers than for unemployed searchers. This may be due to differences in the effectiveness of search while employed versus unemployed or to unobserved differences in search effort. Further research on this issue is needed because many models of job search behavior are based on the assumption that job search is more effective when one is unemployed.",David M. Blau,Philip K.

To explore these issues, we construct a theoretical model of hyperinflation that focuses on individuals and their process of economic exchange. In our model buyers must carry cash while shopping, and some transactions take place in a decentralized setting in which buyer and seller negotiate over the terms of trade of an indivisible good. Since buyers face the constant threat of incoming younger (hence richer) customers, their bargaining position is weakened by inflation, allowing sellers to extract a higher real price. However, we show that higher inflation also reduces buyers' search, increasing sellers' wait for customers. As a result, the volume of transactions concluded in the decentralized sector falls. At high enough rates of inflation, all agents suffer a welfare loss.",Alessandra Casella,Jonathan S. Feinstein,,,,,

We argue that if the variability of the return is not too great, typically the trader will find it desirable to ensure that the market price does not reveal his information, that is, that a ""pooling"" equilibrium arises. Such an equilibrium has the advantage of avoiding the incentive constraints that arise in ""separating"" equilibria, where information can be inferred from prices. Thus the efficient market hypothesis may well fail if there is imperfect competition. Despite the uniformativeness of prices, the other (competitive) traders are also better off in the pooling equilibrium than in any separating equilibrium, again if one assumes limited variability.",Jean-Jacques Laffont,Eric S.

Numerous recent studies, for example, have sought to determine the validity of purchasing power parity using data from the post-Bretton Woods float and have reached different conclusions. We assert that most such studies are flawed for two reasons. First, the post-1973 data contain, by definition, only a very limited amount of the low-frequency information relevant for examination of long-run parity. Second, the dynamic econometric techniques used to model deviations from parity are typically quite crude with respect to admissible low-frequency dynamics. Both deficiencies are rectified in the present paper, with dramatic results. We construct a new data set of 16 real exchange rates covering more than a century of the classic gold standard period, and we study deviations from parity using long-memory models that allow for subtle forms of mean reversion.

Long-distance international commerce during the mercantilist period was undertaken chiefly by state-chartered monopoly trading companies and was therefore conducted under conditions of imperfect competition. The economic structure of the Anglo-Dutch rivalry for the East India trade provides an excellent illustration of an environment in which the profit-sharting motive for strategic trade policies exists. Dutch supremacy in the early East India trade was facilitated by a managerial incentive scheme in the monopoly charter that enabled it to achieve a Stackelberg leadership position against the English. Using data from the East India trade around 1620 in a Cournot duopoly model, I find that the managerial incentives yielded greater Dutch profits than would have been obtained from a standard profit-maximizing objective and that the scope for other strategic trade policies was clearly present.",Douglas A.

The test involves regressing the change in household consumption onto the change in aggregate consumption and other right-hand-side variables such as the change in household income and change in employment status. All variables other than the change in aggregate consumption are predicted to be insignificant in explaining the change in household consumption.

Using data on geographically isolated monopolies, duopolies, and oligopolies, we study the relationship between the number of firms in a market, market size, and competition. Our empirical results suggest that competitive conduct changes quickly as the number of incumbents increases.

We ask how much redistribution occurs when only local governments can have tax/transfer instruments, individuals can move freely among jurisdictions, and voters in each jurisdiction are fully aware of the migration effects of redistributive policies. Local redistribution is shown to induce sorting of the population, with the poorest households located in the communities that provide the most redistribution.

In the absence of restrictions, investment by itself will keep the price from rising above a natural ceiling that exceeds the long-run average cost by an option value factor. When a lower ceiling is imposed, investment is triggered only by the observation of an even higher ""shadow"" price. As the imposed ceiling is reduced to the long-run average cost, this shadow price goes to infinity and investment ceases completely. Because investment is depressed, a tighter price ceiling generally leads to a higher long-run average price.",Avinash Dixit,,,,,,

The traditional weakening of this assumption is to allow for habit formation. I propose an alternative structure for intertemporal preferences that nests intertemporal additivity in a simple way and yields closed-form solutions for demand functions. This structure includes the neoclassical durables model as a special case. I derive a demand system that nests the almost ideal system as its time-separable counterpart. This model is estimated on U.K. aggregate time-series data for seven goods. Time separability is decisively rejected. Moreover, I find that ignoring temporal dependencies leads to considerable bias in the estimates of elasticities. Of the seven goods, durables display the strongest nonseparable effect; the estimated reactions are consistent with the neoclassical durables model.",Martin Browning,,,,,,

I find that 10 years of current job seniority raise the wage of the typical male worker in the United States by over 25 percent. This is an estimate of what the typical worker would lose if his job were to end exogenously.

It shows that under general conditions such a policy would produce the well-known cumulative process, despite the fact that there exists a well-behaved rational expectations equilibrium with no tendency for inflation to accelerate or decelerate. The cumulative process shows up as the failure of learning to converge to rational expectations. Specifically, the paper shows, first in a conventional IS-LM model with an expectations-augmented Phillips curve and then in a micro-based finance constraint model, that if people follow any learning rule based on experience that satisfies a weak condition, then the sequence of temporary equilibria under a policy of interest pegging cannot converge. The nonconvergent path that will be observed accords with the familiar cumulative process, in that inflation accelerates if the market rate of interest has been pegged below the natural rate.",Peter Howitt,,,,,,

It adopts a stochastic framework of workers' tastes over job attributes and models their equilibrium wage-job attribute choices. Workers' productivity is assumed to consist of observed and unobserved components. Applying the standard estimation methodology, we find that the degree of bias can be surprisingly large.

I analyze the behavior of farm PACs over three election cycles. In contrast to previous findings, I find that contributor behavior is not inconsistent with rational behavior.

Since prices are primarily determined by costs, demand shocks have small effects on real wages. Thus insiders have little incentive to change to more complicated contracts. With rigid nominal wages, nominal demand shocks have large effects on the employment opportunities of outsiders, but outsiders have little influence on labor contracts.",Nils Gottfries,,,,,,

We find that the effect of expected inflation on intramarket price variability is stronger than the effect of unexpected inflation. We show that even in times of high inflation, price quotations are not trivially short and price changes are not synchronized across firms. These facts, taken together, confirm that there is some staggering in the setting of prices. We find that the distribution of real prices is far from being uniform, as many menu cost-based models assume or conclude. In fact, as inflation increases to very high levels, this distribution is not even symmetric. When the annual inflation rate reaches 130 percent, there are equal chances of finding real prices above or below the market average, but upward deviations in the real price are further away from zero than downward ones. Furthermore, as the annual rate of inflation more than doubles from 60 to 130 percent, real prices are pushed toward both tails of the distribution.",Saul Lach,Daniel Tsiddon,,,,,

Equilibrium net rates of return are major determinants of the amount of owner housing, but a logit model indicates that demographic factors are the main determinants of ownership rates.

Intervention by special-interest groups was also important in the regulatory process. Comments by grower organizations significantly reduced the probability of cancellation, whereas comments by environmental advocacy groups increased the probability of cancellation.

Producers allocate the available supply among all potential batches of buyers. Inventories accumulate whenever a batch does not arrive. Shocks to cost and demand are serially independent. There is a stationary relationship between inventories and prices with the following properties. Larger beginning-of-period inventories tend to depress prices. Inventories are positively serially correlated. A unit increase in inventories reduces output by less than one unit. An increase in inventories leads to an increase in the price spread.

This paper builds a general equilibrium model of this reallocation process, calibrates it using data on firm-level dynamics, and evaluates the aggregate implications of policies that interfere with this process. We find that a tax on job destruction at the firm level has a sizable negative impact on total employment: a tax equal to 1 year's wages reduces employment by roughly 2.5 percent. More striking, however, are the welfare consequences: the cost in terms of consumption of this same tax is greater than 2 percent. The mechanism through which this welfare loss arises is apparently a decrease in average productivity, since this policy results in a decrease in average productivity of over 2 percent.",Hugo Hopenhayn,Richard Rogerson,,,,,

Acreage controls are shown to enhance the efficiency of redistribution under a target price program. More specifically, this study demonstrates that if the traditional Cobb-Douglas production function is assumed, acreage controls do not enhance the efficiency of target price programs in the process of redistributing income to the farm sector. The study proves that if the elasticity of substitution between land and all other inputs is less than one, then the income redistributional costs are likely to be reduced. Moreover, by using an empirical estimate of the elasticity of substitution and farm data for the time period 1984-88, this study demonstrates that acreage control programs have drastically reduced the deadweight losses associated with income redistribution flowing from target price programs. These results lend strong support to the public choice notion that politicians favor efficient favor efficient redistribution schemes.",Micha Gisser,,,,,,

Models of adverse selection suggest that the dealer type that sells a higher proportion of its trade-ins on the wholesale market will sell, on average, cars of higher quality and receive in return a higher price. A survey of dealers' wholesale behavior and prices collected at a wholesale auction are used to test this prediction. I find weak evidence for adverse selection.",David Genesove,,,,,,

It shows that the stock price incorporates performance information that cannot be extracted from the firm's current or future profit data. The additional information is useful for structuring managerial incentives. The amount of information contained in the stock price depends on the liquidity of the market. Concentrated ownership, by reducing market liquidity, reduces the benefits of market monitoring. Integration is associated with weakened managerial incentives and less market monitoring. This may explain why shares of divisions of a firm are rarely traded. The model offers a reason why market liquidity and monitoring have both a private and a social value, a feature missing in standard finance models. This is used to study the equilibrium size of the stock market as a function of investor preferences and the available amounts of long- and short-term capital.",Bengt Holmström,Jean Tirole,,,,,

Returns to schooling fall by about one-third when parental schooling is added to wage equations. Surprisingly, the schooling of fathers-in-law has larger effects on wages than the schooling of fathers. On the basis of a model of assortative mating, we interpret this as evidence that parental characteristics represent unobservable worker attributes rather than nepotism in the labor market.

We find that the trend toward increased wage inequality is apparent within narrowly defined education and labor market experience groups. Our interpretation is that much of the increase in wage inequality for males over the last 20 years is due to increased returns to the components of skill other than years of schooling and years of labor market experience. Our primary explanation for the general rise in returns to skill is that the demand for skill rose in the United States over this period.",Chinhui Juhn,Kevin M. Murphy,Brooks Pierce,,,,

For the construction of the second submodel, the tool of a ""perceptron"" is borrowed from the parallel computation literature.

Our results support the view that a significant proportion of movements in the Solow residual are artifacts of labor hoarding behavior. Specifically, we estimate that the variance of innovations to technology is roughly 50 percent less than that implied by standard real business cycle models.

Because of capital market imperfections, poor agents choose working for a wage over self-employment, and wealthy agents become entrepreneurs who monitor workers. Only with sufficient inequality, however, will there be employment contracts; otherwise, there is either subsistence or self-employment. Thus, in static equilibrium, the occupational structure depends on distribution. Since the latter is itself endogenous, we demonstrate the robustness of this result by extending the model dynamically and studying examples in which initial wealth distributions have long-run effects. In one case the economy develops either widespread cottage industry (self-employment) or factory production (employment contracts), depending on the initial distribution; in the other example, it develops into prosperity or stagnation.",Abhijit V.

We study an equilibrium model in which the males who regard their prospects as unusually good choose to wait until their economic success is revealed before choosing a bride. In equilibrium, the most desirable young females choose successful older males. Young males who believe that time will not treat them kindly will offer to marry at a young age.

However, statistical significance for some of the effects is weak, although the magnitudes are large. Also, there is little evidence of the use of relative performance pay. Nevertheless, while puzzles remain, it seems clear that principal-agent considerations play a role in setting executive compensation.",John E. Garen,,,,,,

Documenting the precise nature of these spillovers is crucial for determining the advisability of such policies and is helpful for understanding the contribution of learning to endogenous growth. Yet existing empirical evidence on learning by doing in semiconductor production is scant and evidence on spillovers is nonexistent. Using quarterly, firm-level data on seven generations of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) semiconductors over 1974-92, we find that (a) learning rates average 20 percent, (b) firms learn three times more from an additional unit of their own cumulative production than from an additional unit of another firm's cumulative production, (c) learning spills over just as much between firms in different countries as between firms within a given country, (d) Japanese firms are indistinguishable from others in learning speed, and (e) intergenerational learning spillovers are weak, being marginally significant in only two of seven DRAM generations.",Douglas A.

https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/261957,A Theory of Conformity,102,5,Oct.,1994,"This paper analyzes a model of social interaction in which individuals care about status as well as ""intrinsic"" utility (which refers to utility derived directly from consumption). Status is assumed to depend on public perceptions about an individual's predispositions rather than on the individual's actions. However, since predispositions are unobservable, actions signal predispositions and therefore affect status. When status is sufficiently important relative to intrinsic utility, many individuals conform to a single, homogeneous standard of behavior, despite heterogeneous underlying preferences. They are willing to conform because they recognize that even small departures from the social norm will seriously impair their status. The fact that society harshly censures all nonconformists is not simply assumed (indeed, status varies smoothly with perceived type); rather, it is produced endogenously. Despite this penalty, agents with sufficiently extreme preferences refuse to conform. The model provides an explanation for the fact that standards of behavior govern some activities but do not govern others. It also suggests a theory of how standards of behavior might evolve in response to changes in the distribution of intrinsic preferences. In particular, for some values of the preference parameters, norms are both persistent and widely followed; for other values, norms are transitory and confined to small groups. Thus the model produces both customs and fads. Finally, an extension of the model suggests an explanation for the development of multiple subcultures, each with its own distinct norm.",B.

This limits the ability to address a question that seems to be at the heart of developmental failures: Why do societies fail to adopt the institutional structure of more economically successful ones? This paper integrates game-theoretical and sociological concepts to conduct a comparative historical analysis of the relations between culture and institutional structure. It examines cultural factors that have led two premodern societies--one from the Muslim world and the other from the Latin world--to evolve along distinct trajectories of institutional structure. It indicates the theoretical importance of culture in determining institutional structures, in leading to their path dependence, and in forestalling successful intersociety adoption of institutions. Since the distinct institutional structures found in the late medieval period resemble those differentiating contemporary developing and developed economies, the paper suggests the historical importance of distinct cultures in economic development.",Avner Greif,,,,,,

This paper describes and interprets the economic history of the law, presents a theoretical model of its economic effects, and provides quantitative estimates of the impacts on output, prices, and economic welfare, following a partial deregulation under a 1978 amendment to the law. The analysis shows that large social costs have arisen from concentrating control over the genetic base for California cotton production in the hands of a single government cotton breeder and restricting production to the use of a single selection of a single variety. Some of these costs have been eliminated by the partial deregulation in 1978 to permit private breeders to compete in the provision of genetic material, but production is still restricted to the Acala variety of cotton. While the regulation has benefited some, perhaps even a majority, of the industry participants, it has been increasingly harmful to some other growers and costly overall. The persistence of this costly regulation may be due to the distribution of its impacts: the partial deregulation yielded large increases in aggregate producer surplus but many growers experienced small losses.",John H.

Our model and empirical results show that state ownership can lower the long-run annual rate of productivity growth or cost decline, but not necessarily their levels in the short run. Observed level differences in productive efficiency across private and state-owned firms may thus be a function of the age distribution of the firms being compared. These results appear to be independent of whether the firms operate under apparently more or less competitive or regulated markets and whether they differ in production scales.

There is an equivalence class of ex post capital income tax rates and bond policies that support a given allocation. Within this class, the optimal ex post capital tax rates can range from close to independently and identically distributed to close to a random walk. The tax rate on labor income fluctuates very little and inherits the persistence properties of the exogenous shocks; thus there is no presumption that optimal labor tax rates follow a random walk.

The data show that within-cohort consumption and income inequality measures do indeed increase with age in the three economies and that the rate of increase is similar in all three. According to the permanent income hypothesis, the increase in inequality reflects cumulative differences in the effects of luck on consumption. Other models of intertemporal choice--such as those with strong precautionary motives or liquidity constraints--can limit or even prevent the spread of inequality, as can insurance arrangements that share risk across individuals. The evidence on the spread of inequality can therefore be used to help quantify the extent to which private and social arrangements moderate the impact of risk on the distribution of individual welfare.",Angus Deaton,Christina Paxson,,,,,

As the firms' technologies gradually improve, industry output expands and price falls. Technological leaders tend to rely on innovations to reduce their costs, whereas the laggards rely more on imitation. Imitation causes technology to spread from the leaders to the followers and forces some convergence of technology among firms as the industry matures. This convergence is accompanied by faster growth of smaller firms and a consequent tightening of the distribution of output over firms. Since imitation is a kind of spillover of technology, equilibrium is likely to involve insufficient innovative and imitative effort relative to a social optimum.",Boyan Jovanovic,Glenn M.

These data allow us to identify those individuals who were sole proprietors in 1981 and to determine the extent to which the decision to remain a sole proprietor was influenced by the magnitude of the inheritance-induced increase in liquidity. The results are consistent with the notion that liquidity constraints exert a noticeable influence on the viability of entrepreneurial enterprises. For example, a $150,000 inheritance increases the probability than an individual will continue as a sole proprietor by 1.3 percentage points, and if the enterprise survives, it receipts increase by almost 20 percent.",Douglas Holtz-Eakin,David Joulfaian,Harvey S.

The model predicts that the existence of a short-time compensation (STC) system will generate major fluctuations in working hours only if the STC system is more generous than the traditional unemployment insurance system. A test performed for 10 OECD countries shows that in countries with generous STC systems, the speed of adjustment of total hours worked is higher than in the United States, despite a much slower adjustment in the number of workers employed. On the other hand, in countries with less generous STC systems, hours adjustments are far from compensating the slower employment adjustments.",Marc A. Van Audenrode,,,,,,

Among the developed countries, convergence in education levels has resulted in a reduction in income dispersion. However, for the world as a whole, incomes have diverged despite substantial convergence in education levels. This is a result of increases in the return to education that favor the developed countries at the expense of the less developed countries.",Donal O'Neill,,,,,,

I develop a structural model of the demand for wives that disentangles wealth and substitution effects. Using a large household survey from Côte d'Ivoire, I find that marked geographic diversity in cropping patterns leads to regional variation in female labor productivity. I also find that, conditional on wealth, men do have more wives when women are more productive, that is, cheaper. This substitution effect may explain why polygyny declined in rural areas of Côte d'Ivoire during agricultural development             ",Hanan G. Jacoby,,,,,,

To test this idea, we dispense with the Walrasian description of the labor market and introduce contractual arrangements between employees and employers. Assuming that employees are prevented from accessing capital markets and are more risk averse than employers, we use the theory of optimal contracts to derive an equilibrium relation between aggregate states of the economy and wage-labor outcomes. This contractual arrangement is then embedded into a standard one-sector, stochastic neoclassical growth model in order to look at the business cycle implications of the contractual hypothesis. The resulting dynamic equilibrium relations are then parameterized and studied by means of standard numerical approximation techniques. The quantitative properties of our model appear to be somewhat encouraging. We have examined different contractual environments, and in all circumstances the contracts-based equilibrium performs better than standard ones with regard to the labor market variables and at least as well with regard to the other aggregate macroeconomic variables.

More specifically, for mature capital goods industries, there is evidence of MAR externalities but none of Jacobs externalities. For new high-tech industries, there is evidence of Jacobs and MAR externalities. These findings are consistent with notions of urban specialization and product cycles: new industries prosper in large, diverse metropolitan areas, but with maturity, production decentralizes to smaller, more specialized cities.

Highly skilled workers have an absolute advantage in all jobs and a comparative advantage in complex jobs. Utility is represented by a constant elasticity of substitution function defined over the output of an infinite number of jobs. Equilibrium is characterized by a mapping of skills on complexities. The model is able simultaneously to explain the remuneration of skill, the allocation of skills to jobs, and variations in labor demand per job type.

In particular, this heterogeneity has been interpreted as evidence against the life cycle model of saving. This paper argues that a life cycle model can replicate observed patterns in household wealth accumulation after accounting explicitly for precautionary saving and asset-based, means-tested social insurance. We demonstrate theoretically that social insurance programs with means tests based on assets discourage saving by households with low expected lifetime income. In addition, we evaluate the model using a dynamic programming model with four state variables. Assuming common preference parameters across lifetime income groups, we are able to replicate the empirical pattern that low-income households are more likely than high-income households to hold virtually no wealth. Low wealth accumulation can be explained as a utility-maximizing response to asset-based, means-tested welfare programs.",R. Glenn Hubbard,Jonathan Skinner,Stephen P. Zeldes,,,,

It develops a rational expectations model of inflation in which the dynamics are driven by the level of government spending and by the effect of past inflation rates on the value of real taxes. Government expenditure is modeled as an exogenous autoregressive process subject to discrete changes in regime. The regimes are defined by whether the level of spending is or is not consistent with the rate of inflation targeted by the government as part of a stabilization program. In making their money demand decision, the agents need to construct probability inferences regarding the state of the expenditure process. Credibility is quantified by the agents' inferred probability that the joint observation of inflation, the nominal interest rate, and government spending is generated by the reformed expenditure regime. In an application to Israel, results indicate that the failed stabilization program of November 1984 was less than fully credible to the agents. The uncertainty about the true nature of the expenditure process partially explains the volatility of the rate of inflation in this period. In contrast, for the July 1985 program the agents correctly inferred a change in the regime driving the government spending process.",Francisco J. Ruge-Murcia,,,,,,

We address this question in the context of the dramatic changes in Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women that took place between 1979 and 1992. We build a detailed simulation model of each state's Medicaid policy during this era and use this model to estimate (1) the effect of changes in the rules on the fraction of women eligible for Medicaid coverage in the event of pregnancy and (2) the effect of Medicaid eligibility changes on birth outcomes in aggregate Vital Statistics data. We have three main findings. First, the changes did dramatically increase the Medicaid eligibility of pregnant women, but did so at quite differential rates across the states. Second, the changes lowered the incidence of infant mortality and low birth weight; we estimate that the 30-percentage-point increase in eligibility among 15-44-year-old women was associated with a decrease in infant mortality of 8.5 percent. Third, earlier, targeted changes in Medicaid eligibility, which were restricted to specific low-income groups, had much larger effects on birth out-comes than broader expansions of eligibility to women with higher income levels. We suggest that the source of this difference is the much lower take-up of Medicaid coverage by individuals who became eligible under the broader eligibility changes. Even the targeted changes cost the Medicaid program $840,000 per infant life saved, however, raising important issues of cost effectiveness.",Janet Currie,Jonathan Gruber,,,,,

Independent evidence shows that this test score is a racially unbiased measure of the skills and abilities these teenagers were about to bring to the labor market. We find that this one test score explains all of the black-white wage gap for young women and much of the gap for young men.

The agents trade in financial securities to buffer their idiosyncratic income shocks, but the extent of trade is limited by borrowing constraints, short-sales constraints, and transactions costs. By simultaneously considering aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks, we decompose the effect of transactions costs on the equity premium into two components. The direct effect occurs because individuals equate the net-of-cost margins. A second, indirect effect occurs because transactions costs result in individual consumption that more closely tracks individual income. In the simulations we find that the direct effect dominates and that the model can produce a sizable equity premium only if transactions costs are large or the assumed quantity of tradable assets is limited.",John Heaton,Deborah J.

Consumer-specific characteristics fail to explain dealer discounts, whereas model, market-specific, and purchase transaction variables (e.g., first-time purchase, trade-in, and financing through dealer) do explain them. The results contradict earlier findings of race and gender discrimination based on a controlled experiment. This contradiction is reconciled by examining the higher moments of the empirical discount distribution; while mean and median markups do not vary by race and gender, minority purchases are characterized by higher dispersion. This may rationalize the disparate treatment of minorities by dealers documented in the controlled experiment.",Pinelopi Koujianou Goldberg,,,,,,

Plant-level relationships do aggregate in Depression-era blast furnace operations despite the presence of very substantial interplant heterogeneity, the most common economic cause of nonaggregability. The economic explanation of this lies in poor short-run substitutability of one plant's output for another's.

https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/262027,Reputation Formation in Early Bank Note Markets,104,2,Apr.,1996,"Two hypotheses concerning firms issuing debt for the first time are tested. The first is that new firms' debt will be discounted more heavily by lenders, compared to firms that have credit histories (but are otherwise identical), and that this excess discount declines over time as lenders observe defaults. The declining interest rate corresponds to the formation of a ""reputation,"" a valuable asset that provides an incentive for firms not to choose risky projects. The second hypothesis is that prior to the establishment of a reputation, new firms issuing debt are monitored more intensely. The sample studied consists of new banks issuing bank notes for the first time during the American Free Banking Era (1838-60). The presence of a reputation effect in note prices is confirmed: the notes of new banks are discounted more heavily than the notes of banks with credit histories. Note holders are then motivated to monitor new banks because the excess discount provides an incentive for the notes of new banks to be redeemed. As lenders learn that new banks can redeem their notes, the discount declines as predicted for surviving banks. The precision of learning increases during the period because of technological improvements in information transmission, namely, the introduction of the telegraph and the railroad. The results explain why the pre-Civil War system of private money issuance by banks was not plagued by problems of overissuance (""wildcat banking"").",Gary Gorton,,,,,,

The reason is that secondary workers, whose labor supply elasticity is high, will be taxed at a lower marginal rate than primary workers, whose labor supply elasticity is low. Here, we argue that once household production is taken into account, things are more complicated since tax design should also not distort the input of family members' time in household production. Factor input distortions as well as Ramsey considerations thus need to enter the choice of the tax unit. We provide a numerical example of an economy for which a move from an individual to a household basis in the income tax can be efficiency improving. We then use a general equilibrium model, parameterized using Australian tax rates and data, whose results clearly show that welfare gains can occur under changes from an individual to a household basis for an existing income tax. Our results thus challenge conventional wisdom and suggest that household unit taxation deserves more sympathetic consideration than is currently the case.",John Piggott,John Whalley,,,,,

Debt structures that lead to inefficient renegotiation are beneficial in that they deter default, but they are also costly if default is beyond a manager's control.

Specifically, the paper tests whether an increase by one dollar in the income of parents actively making transfers to a child coupled with a one dollar reduction in that child's income results in the parents' increasing their transfer to the child by one dollar. This restriction on parental and child transfer‐income derivatives is derived for the standard altruism model augmented to include uncertainty and liquidity constraints. These additional elements pin down the timing of inter vivos transfers. The method used to estimate income‐transfer derivatives takes into account unobserved heterogeneity across families in the degree of altruism. The findings strongly reject the altruism hypothesis. Redistributing one dollar from a recipient child to donor parents leads to less than a 13‐cent increase in the parents' transfer to the child, far less than the one‐dollar increase implied by altruism.",Joseph G.

We use a semiparametric model to estimate the shape of the flow‐performance relationship for a sample of growth and growth and income funds observed over the 1982–92 period. The shape of the flow‐performance relationship creates incentives for fund managers to increase or decrease the riskiness of the fund that are dependent on the fund's year‐to‐date return. We examine portfolio holdings of mutual funds in September and December and show that mutual funds do alter the riskiness of their portfolios at the end of the year in a manner consistent with these incentives.",Judith Chevalier,Glenn Ellison,,,,,

The proposed indices control for differences in the size distribution of plants and for differences in the size of the geographic areas for which data are available. As a consequence, comparisons of the degree of geographic concentration across industries can be made with more confidence. Our empirical results provide a strong reaffirmation of the previous wisdom in that we find almost all industries to be somewhat localized.

The desire to avoid highly risky investments slows down capital accumulation, and the inability to diversify idiosyncratic risk introduces a large amount of uncertainty in the growth process. The typical development pattern will consist of a lengthy period of “primitive accumulation” with highly variable output, followed by takeoff and financial deepening and, finally, steady growth. “Lucky” countries will spend relatively less time in the primitive accumulation stage and develop faster. Although all agents are price takers and there are no technological spillovers, the decentralized equilibrium is inefficient because individuals do not take into account their impact on others' diversification opportunities.

In many, perhaps most, decentralized labor markets, this means that transactions have to be finalized before there is time for the market to clear, that is, before all the potential transactions that would need to be evaluated in order to reach a stable outcome can in fact be evaluated. This has implications for the strategic behavior of firms and workers. In particular, in deciding to whom to offer a position, a firm may have strong incentives to consider not only its preferences over workers but also the likelihood that its offer will be accepted, since if its offer is rejected it may find that many other potential employees have become unavailable in the interim.

A new intuitive argument to explain question is presented and tested in simulations using a computable general equilibrium model with parameters set to be consistent with New Jersey data. Both the intuitive argument and the simulation results indicate that setting local income tax rates to zero is a dominant strategy for community planners.

An increase in an agent's real authority promotes initiative but results in a loss of control for the principal. After spelling out (some of) the main determinants of the delegation of formal authority within organizations, the paper examines a number of factors that increase the subordinates' real authority in a formally integrated structure: overload, lenient rules, urgency of decision, reputation, performance measurement, and multiplicity of superiors.

One explanation for the failure to uncover the expected relationship between federal spending and election outcomes is that incumbents who expect to have difficulty being reelected are likely to exert greater effort in obtaining federal outlays. Since it is generally impossible to adequately measure this effort, the estimated impact of spending is biased downward because of an omitted variable bias. We address this estimation problem using instrumental variables. For each House district, we use spending outside the district but inside the state containing the district as an instrument for spending in the district. Federal spending is affected by a large number of actors (e.g., governors, senators, mayors, and other House members in the state delegation), leading to positive correlations in federal spending across the House districts within states. However, federal spending outside of a district is unlikely to be strongly correlated with the strength of that district's electoral challenge. In contrast to previous studies, we find strong evidence that federal spending benefits congressional incumbents: an additional $100 per capita in spending is worth as much as 2 percent of the popular vote.

Systematic econometric biases imply that the estimated offsets in previous empirical studies are smaller than the true offset and may even have the wrong sign. New empirical estimates that do not correct for the biases generate little offset between pensions and other wealth. Estimates that correct for the biases show substantially more offset (a smaller impact of pensions on overall saving) than in most previous studies. The estimates also indicate that the effects of pensions on wealth vary significantly across households.,William G. Gale,,,,,,

Rent appropriation has important macroeconomic consequences. Resources are underutilized, factor markets are segmented, production suffers from technological “sclerosis,” job creation and destruction are unbalanced, recessions are excessively sharp, and expansions run into bottlenecks. While, depending on the shock, expansions may require reinforcement or stabilization, recessions should typically be softened. In the long run, institutions may evolve to alleviate the problem by balancing appropriation. Technology choice will also be affected, with the appropriated factor partially “excluding” the other from production to reduce appropriation.",Ricardo J. Caballero,Mohamad L. Hammour,,,,,

We claim that these incentives in often alter the standard conclusions obtained about old‐age support when mortality is treated exogenously.

We demonstrate that efficient agreements necessarily induce some falsification but that the extent of such claims inflation is mitigated partially by an indemnification schedule that overcompensates small losses while overpaying larger ones.

Or does the state have a role in creating liquidity and regulating it either through adjustments in the stock of government securities or by other means? In our model, firms can meet future liquidity needs in three ways: by issuing new claims, by obtaining a credit line from a financial intermediary, and by holding claims on other firms. When there is no aggregateuncertainty, we show that these instruments are sufficient for implementing the socially optimal (second‐best) contract between investors and firms. However, the implementation may require an intermediary to coordinate the use of scarce liquidity, in which case contracts with the intermediary impose both a maximum leverage ratio and a liquidity constraint on firms. When there is only aggregate uncertainty, the private sector cannot satisfy its own liquidity needs. The government can improve welfare by issuing bonds that commit future consumer income. Government bonds command a liquidity premium over private claims. The government should manage debt so that liquidity is loosened (the value of bonds is high) when the aggregate liquidity shock is high and is tightened when the liquidity shock is low. The paper thus suggests a rationale both for government‐supplied liquidity and for its active management.",Bengt Holmström,Jean Tirole,,,,,

Conventional wisdom and the theoretical predictions of models of endogenous innovation suggest that this increased research effort should lead to more rapid growth. As noted by Charles Jones, this prediction is at odds with the postwar experience of the OECD, where the growth of the market has indeed led to an increased R & D effort that, however, has been translated into stagnat or declining growth rates. Drawing on the remarkable insights of the museum curator Seabury C. Gilfillan, this paper modifies models of endogenous innovation to allow for the possibility that a rise in the profitability of innovative activity could lead to an increased variety of differentiated solutions to similar problems. An increased variety of technologies (e.g., an increase in the number and types of contraceptives) will increase the level of utility of the average consumer. If, however, continued improvement of this increased variety of technologies requires increased research input, a rise in the scale of the market could raise the equilibrium quantity of R & D without increasing the economy's growth rate.",Alwyn Young,,,,,,

For a broad class of models, we characterize the outcome of a contracting game in which manufacturers may employ exclusive dealing provisions in their contracts. We then apply this characterization to a sequence of specialized settings. We demonstrate that exclusionary contractual provisions may be irrelevant, anticompetitive, or efficiency‐enhancing, depending on the setting. More specifically, we exhibit the potential for anticompetitive effects in noncoincident markets (i. e., markets other than the ones in which exclusive dealing is practiced), and we explore the potential for the enhancement of efficiency in a setting in which common representation gives rise to incentive conflicts. In each instance, we describe the manner in which equilibrium outcomes would be altered by a ban on exclusive dealing.

The issue addressed here concerns the economic impact of the large increase in the supply of educated labor. Evidence is presented concerning the sharp decline in the wage premium to ordinary white‐collar workers.

The value of assimilation is larger to an individual from a small minority than to one from a large minority group. When a society has a very large majority of individuals from one culture, individuals from minority groups will be assimilated more quickly. Assimilation is less likely when an immigrant's native culture and language are broadly represented in his or her new country. Also, when governments protect minority interests directly, incentives to be assimilated into the majority culture are reduced. In a pluralistic society, a government policy that encourages diverse cultural immigration over concentrated immigration is likely to increase the welfare of the native population. Sometimes, policies that subsidize assimilation and the acquisition of majority language skills can be socially beneficial. The theory is tested and confirmed by examining U.S. census data, which reveal that the likelihood that an immigrant will learn English is inversely related to the proportion of the local population that speaks his or her native language.",Edward P.

The paper attempts to fill the void through equilibrium models of endogenous growth. “balanced growth” is derived as a balancing act between accumulating human capital, which engenders growth, and accumulating political capital, which mainly assures bureaucratic power. The analysis focuses on the interplay between investment in these two types of capital and its implications for long‐term growth under alternative political regimes. Some propositions are tested and confirmed empirically.",Isaac Ehrlich,Francis T. Lui,,,,,

Intertemporal trade‐offs required by the fact that a sizable fractiono of the potato crop is needed for seed crops can produce unusual market dynamics. The Irish experience is well described by a normal demand model in which a permanent decline in the productivity of seed potatoes was at first mistaken as a transitory crop failure. These mistakes provoked “oversaviong” of seed crop in a population in dire circumstances. With the benefit of hindsight, consumption of seed crop capital was warranted. Erroneous expecations of potato productivity by growers delayed necessary agricultural adjustments and contributed to the catastrophe later on.",Sherwin Rosen,,,,,,

Using cross‐sectional time‐series data for 1870–1940, we examine state government expenditures and revenue as well as voting by U.S. House and Senate state delegations and the passage of a wide range of different state laws. Suffrage coincided with immediate increases in state government expenditures and revenue and more liberal voting patterns for federal representatives, and these effects continued growing over time as more women took advantage of the franchise. Contrary to many recent suggestions, the gender gap is not something that has arisen since the 1970s, and it helps explain why American government started growing when it did.","John R.

In an optimal regime, violators are prompted to voluntarily remediate—or self‐police—by the promise of a reduced sanction when they do so. Self‐policing increases efficiency in two ways: (1) efficient remediation is achieved early and with certainty, rather than only when a violator is apprehended; and (2) the enforcement effort needed to deter violations is often reduced. Switching to a self‐policing enforcement regime leads optimally to less government enforcement activity and less deterrence.",Robert Innes,,,,,,

The bound is derived from necessary conditions for the optimality of consumption choices in the presence of fixed transaction costs. These conditions reduce to standard Euler equations when transaction costs are zero. Conservative point estimates suggest that a consumer with log utility who consumes U.

In addition, franchisors do not systematically increase or decrease their royalty rates or franchise fees as they become better established, contrary to predictions from some specific theoretical models.

Since 1970, there has been a decline in segregation as blacks have moved into previously all‐white areas of cities and suburbs.

Data on house prices and attitudes toward integration suggest that in the mid‐twentieth century, segregation was a product of collective actions taken by whites to exclude blacks from their neighborhoods.

Estimates that recognize that demand conditions and vendor labor supply decisions simultaneously determine the vendor wage always find substantial labor supply elasticities, typically in the .55–.65 range. In contrast, estimates that ignore the endogeneity of the vendor wage yield severely downward-biased labor supply elasticities.

After observing that many organizations (corporations, judiciary, and the executive and legislative branches of government) use competition among enfranchised advocates of special interests to improve policy making, it argues that advocacy has two major benefits. First, the advocates' rewards closely track their pursuing several conflicting causes at one time. Second, advocacy enhances the integrity of decision making by creating strong incentives to appeal in case of an abusive decision. The paper also analyzes the costs of advocacy in terms of manipulation and garbling of information. It further shows that it may be costly for both the organization and interested parties themselves to let these parties plead their own causes instead of being represented.

First, the social system is modeled as a hierarchy, and implicit within it is a selection process that determines who advances to higher levels. Second, an agent's behavior is partially determined by imitating those who have risen in the ranks. A behavioral norm of being rigid is found to be more prevalent and robust than one of being flexible.

In general, the pay‐performance sensitivity for executives at firms with the least volatile stock prices is an order of magnitude greater than the pay‐performance sensitivity for executives at firms with the least volatile stock prices.

While there are other differences between these countries, this paper explores how variations in the political system per se influence equilibrium redistributive tax rates and income distributions. A three‐party proportional representation model is developed in which taxes are determined through legislative bargaining among successful electoral parties, and the economic decision for individuals is occupational choice.

This market offers firms facing high marginal abatement costs the opportunity to purchase the right to emit SO2 from firms with lower costs, and this is expected to yield cost savings compared to a command‐and‐control approach to environmental regulation. This paper uses econometrically estimated marginal abatement cost functions for power plants affected by Title IV of the CAAA to evaluate the performance of the SO2 allowance market. Specifically, we investigate whether the much‐heralded fall in the cost of abating SO2, compared to original estimates, can be attributed to allowance trading. We demonstrate that, for plants that use low‐sulfur coal to reduce SO2 emissions, technical change and the fall in prices of low‐sulfur coal have lowered marginal abatement cost curves by over 50 percent since 1985. The flexibility to take advantage of these changes is the main source of cost reductions, rather than trading per se. In the long run, allowance trading may achieve cost savings of $700–$800 million per year compared to an “enlightened” command‐and‐control program characterized by a uniform emission rate standard. The cost savings would be twice as great if the alternative to trading were forced scrubbing. However, a comparison of potential cost savings in 1995 and 1996 with modeled costs of actual emissions suggests that most trading gains were unrealized in the first two years of the program.",Curtis Carlson,Dallas Burtraw,Maureen Cropper,Karen L.

We show that the key variable governing the adoption decision is the product of the interest rate times the total amount of assets. This implies that the interest elasticity of household money demand at low interest rates can be estimated from the variation in asset holdings in a cross section of households rather than historical interest rate variations. We do so with the 1989 Survey of Consumer Finances. We find that (a) the elasticity of money demand is very small when the interest rate is small, (b) the probability that a household holds any amount of interest‐bearing assets is positively related to the level of financial assets, and (c) the cost of adopting financial technologies is negatively related to participation in a pension program. At interest rates of 5 percent, roughly one‐half of the elasticity can be attributed to the Allais‐Baumol‐Tobin or intensive margin and half to the new adopters or extensive margin. The intensive margin is less important at lower interest rates and more important at higher interest rates. Finally, we argue that ignoring extensive margins may lead to an empirically important overestimation of the cost of inflation at low interest rates.",Casey B. Mulligan,Xavier Sala‐i‐Martin,,,,,

We find that poorer households are not able to do so. Furthermore, poor southern households do not engage in complete risk sharing; women in these households bear the brunt of adverse shocks. This result implies that the collective model of household organization, which imposes Pareto efficiency on allocations, is rejected for these households. Finally, we obtain estimates of the relative Pareto weights in household allocation.

The resulting decision rules and                     equilibrium conditions are used to estimate the underlying parameters of the                     model using aggregate data. These policy functions are used to evaluate the                     short‐ and long‐run effects of the French policies. We find that                     these policies do stimulate the automobile sector in the short run but, through                     the induced changes in the cross‐sectional distribution of car ages,                     create the basis for subsequent low activity. Further, while these policies                     increase government revenues in the short run, revenues in the long run are                     lower relative to a baseline without intervention.",Jérôme Adda,Russell Cooper,,,,,

The model predicts that in the long run, average earnings within any education group will grow more slowly than average wages overall. It also predicts that average earnings in high‐education groups ultimately will rise relative to average earnings in low‐education groups.

Posted prices in two geographically distinct markets are shown to vary considerably across pharmacies within the same market, even after one controls for variation due to pharmacy differences. Pharmacy heterogeneity accounts for at most one‐third of the observed price dispersion. The empirical analysis hinges on the observation that consumers’ incentives to price‐shop depend on characteristics of the drug therapy. Cross‐sectional patterns in price distributions across drugs are consistent with the predictions of a search model: prices for repeatedly purchased prescriptions (for which the expected benefits of search are highest) exhibit significant reductions in both dispersion and price‐cost margins.",Alan T.

https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/262126,Prices Rise Faster than They Fall,108,3,June,2000,"Output prices tend to respond faster to input increases than to decreases. This tendency is found in more than two of every three markets examined. It is found as frequently in producer goods markets as in consumer goods markets. In both kinds of markets the asymmetric response to cost shocks is substantial and durable. On average, the immediate response to a positive cost shock is at least twice the response to a negative shock, and that difference is sustained for at least five to eight months. Unlike past studies, which documented similar asymmetries in selected markets (gasoline, agricultural products, etc.), this one uses large samples of diverse products: 77 consumer and 165 producer goods. Accordingly, the results suggest a gap in an essential part of economic theory. As a start on filling this gap, the study finds no asymmetry in the resonse of an individual decision maker (a supermarket chain) to its costs, but it finds above‐average asymmetry where a cost shock is filtered through a fragmented wholesale distribution system. It also finds a negative correlation between the degree of asymmetry and input price volatility and no correlation with proxies for inventory costs, asymmetric menu costs of price changes, and imperfect competition.",Sam Peltzman,,,,,,

The differential cannot be explained by the selection of low‐ability employees into self‐employment and is similar for three alternative measures of self‐employment earnings and across industries.

The relationship banking aspect of financial intermediation is emphasized: firms turn to banks as a source of investment mainly because banks are good at helping them through times of financial distress. This financial flexibility is costly since banks face costs of capital themselves (which they attempt to minimize through securitization). To avoid this intermediation cost, firms may turn to bond or equity financing, but bonds imply an inefficient liquidation cost and equity an informational dilution cost. We show that in equilib‐rium the riskier firms prefer bank loans, the safer ones tap the bond markets, and the ones in between prefer to issue both equity and bonds.

https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/262122,What Happens When You Tax the Rich? Evidence from Executive Compensation,108,2,April,2000,"This paper examines the responsiveness of taxable income to changes in marginal tax rates using detailed compensation data on several thousand corporate executives from 1991 to 1995. The data confirm that the higher marginal rates of 1993 led to a significant decline in taxable income. Indeed, this small group of executives may account for as much as 20 percent of the aggregate change in wage and salary income for approximately the one million richest taxpayers over this time period; one person alone can account for more than 2 percent. The decline, however, is almost entirely a short‐run shift in the timing of compensation rather than a permanent reduction in taxable income. The short‐run elasticity of taxable income with respect to the net‐of‐tax share exceeds one in this sample, but the elasticity after one year is at most 0.4 and probably closer to zero. Breaking out the tax responsiveness of different types of compensation shows that the large short‐run responses come almost entirely from a large increase in the exercise of stock options by the highest‐income executives in anticipation of the rate increases. Executives without stock options, executives with relatively lower incomes, and more conventional forms of taxable compensation such as salary and bonus show little responsiveness to tax changes.",Austan Goolsbee,,,,,,

The differential in regulation favors attainment areas, reducing births for polluting industries in nonattainment areas by 26–45 percent.

The bounds assume that investors would want to buy assets with high Sharpe ratios‐“good deals”‐as well as pure arbitrage opportunities. We show how to calculate the price bounds in one‐period, multiperiod, and continuous‐time contexts. We show that the multiperiod problem can be solved recursively as a sequence of one‐period problems. We calculate bounds in option pricing examples including infrequent trading and an option written on a nontraded event, and we use the bounds to explore the economic significance of option pricing predictions.

We strengthen the absence of arbtrage assumption by precluding investment opportunities whose attractiveness to a benchmark investor exceeds a specified threshold. In our framework, the attractiveness of an investment opportunity is measured by the gain‐loss ratio. We show that a restriction on the maximum gain‐loss ratio is equivalent to a restriction on the ratio of the maximum to minimum values of the pricing kernel. By limiting the maximum gainloss ratio, we can restrict the admissible set of pricing kernels, which in turn allows us to restrict the set of prices that can be assigned to assets. We illustrate our methodology by computing price bounds for call options in a Black‐Scholes economy without intermediate trading. When we vary the maximum permitted gainloss ratio, these bounds can range from the exact prices implied by a model‐based pricing approach to the loose price bounds implied by the no‐arbitrage approach.",Antonio E.

This result is shown to flow specifically from a stylized description of the research process as one of brute‐force testing, unaided by an organizing scientific framework. Scientific models channel research effort toward leads for which the expected productivity of discoveries is highest. Leads of unusual promise then command information rents, associated with their role in reducing the costs of search. When genetic materials are abundant, information rents are virtually unaffected by increases in the profitability of product discovery and decline as technology improvements lower search costs.

We show that in all games belonging to a fixed and open neighborhood of the limit game there exists a generically unique equilibrium outcome that exhibits Coasian dynamics and in which play lasts for at most two periods. A laboratory experiment shows that, consistent with our theory, outcomes in the Certain and Uncertain Demand treatments are the same.

The model is estimated on panel data of the states of the United States from 1882 to 1990. The estimates indicate that teacher quality is relatively more important for human capital accumulation than individual instruction. The model accounts for all the mean growth in state per capita incomes and between 80 and 100 percent of convergence in state per capita incomes.",Robert Tamura,,,,,,

Sellers post prices, and then buyers choose sellers. In symmetric equilibrium, similar sellers all post one price, and buyers randomize. Hence, more or fewer buyers may arrive than a seller can accommodate. We call this frictions. We solve for prices and the endogenous matching function for finite n and m and consider the limit as n and m grow. The matching function displays decreasing returns but converges to constant returns. We argue that the standard matching function in the literature is misspecified and discuss implications for the Beveridge curve.",Kenneth Burdett,Shouyong Shi,Randall Wright,,,,

Previous research has suffered from a lack of reliable data on gun ownership. I exploit a unique data set to reliably estimate annual rates of gun ownership at both the state and the county levels during the past two decades. My findings demonstrate that changes in gun ownership are significantly positively related to changes in the homicide rate, with this relationship driven almost entirely by an impact of gun ownership on murders in which a gun is used. The effect of gun ownership on all other crime categories is much less marked. Recent reductions in the fraction of households owning a gun can explain one‐third of the differential decline in gun homicides relative to nongun homicides since 1993.",Mark Duggan,,,,,,

This results because some potential high school dropouts and university enrollees choose the high school graduate designation in order to take advantage of high‐ability individuals who are constrained from entering university. This is in stark contrast to human capital theory, which predicts higher university enrollment but identical high school dropout rates in regions with greater university access. I test the contradictory high school dropout predictions of the human capital and signaling models using NLSYM and NLSYW education data from the late 1960s and early 1970s.

We find empirically that most of the regional convergence is attributable to the structural transformation: the nationwide convergence of agricultural wages to nonagricultural wages and the faster rate of transition of the southern labor force from agricultural to nonagricultural jobs. Similar results describe the Midwest’s catch‐up to the Northeast (but not the relative experience of the West). To explain these observations, we construct a model in which the South (Midwest) has a comparative advantage in producing unskilled labor–intensive agricultural goods. Thus it starts with a disproportionate share of the unskilled labor force and lower per capita incomes. Over time, declining education/training costs induce an increasing proportion of the labor force to move out of the (unskilled) agricultural sector and into the (skilled) nonagricultural sector. The decline in the agricultural labor force leads to an increase in relative agricultural wages. Both effects benefit the South (Midwest) disproportionately since it has more agricultural workers. With the addition of a less than unit income elasticity of demand for farm goods and faster technological progress in farming than outside of farming, this model successfully matches the quantitative features of the U.S. structural transformation and regional convergence, as well as several other stylized facts on U.S. economic growth in the last century.

https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/321020,"Social Approval, Values, and AFDC: A Reexamination of the Illegitimacy Debate",109,3,June,2001,"This paper models the fertility decision of individuals who differ in their wage rate and their intensity of preferences for rearing children, and whose utility of having a child out of wedlock depends on the level of “social approval” associated with doing so. This social approval in turn is a function of the fraction of individuals in previous generations that chose to have children out of wedlock. The model is a straightforward extension of the typical rational choice model that motivates much of the empirical literature—a literature that has cast doubt on a strong link between AFDC and illegitimacy. However, the model introduces elements from epidemic models that many have in mind when arguing for such a link. As a result, the predictions of this extended model are consistent with empirical findings while at the same time linking the rise in illegitimacy solely to government welfare programs. Specifically, a program similar to AFDC is introduced into an economy with low illegitimacy rates, and a transition path to a new steady state is calculated. Along the transition path, observed cases of illegitimacy are rising among both the poor and nonpoor despite the fact that AFDC payments are held constant or even falling. The simultaneous trends of declining real welfare benefits and rising illegitimacy over the past two and a half decades are therefore not inconsistent with the view that illegitimacy might be caused primarily by government welfare policies. Although this paper certainly does not claim to prove such a link, it does suggest that current empirical approaches have been focused too much on an artificially narrow model and have thus given rise to results that can be differently interpreted in the context of a more natural model. At the same time, the model also suggests that welfare reform aimed at reducing the incentives for poor women to have out‐of‐wedlock births may not be as effective as policy makers who believe in a causal link between AFDC and illegitimacy might suspect.",Thomas J.

The two key assumptions are constraints on lump‐sum transfers from poorer members and disproportionate control rights wielded by wealthier members. Transfers of rents to the latter are achieved by depressing prices paid for inputs supplied by members and diverting resulting retained earnings. The theory predicts that increased heterogeneity of landholdings in the local area causes increased inefficiency by inducing a lower input price and a lower level of installed crushing capacity. Predictions concerning the effect of the distribution of local landownership on sugarcane price, capacity levels, and participation rates of different classes of farmers are confirmed by data from nearly 100 sugar cooperatives in the Indian state of Maharashtra over the period 1971–93.",Abhijit Banerjee,Dilip Mookherjee,Kaivan Munshi,Debraj Ray,,,

One type is each person’s independent (or private) leisure, and the other type is spousal leisure, whose importance has long been emphasized in the literature of psychology. While each type of leisure is unobservable (only total leisure is observed), it is shown that the recent collective models of the intrahousehold allocation initiated by Chiappori can be extended to identify each type of leisure up to an additive constant. In particular, the effects of each member’s wage, household unearned income, and extrahousehold environmental parameters on the independent and spousal leisure and on the sharing rule are fully identified. The observational requirement here is the same as in other studies, namely, the observation of individual labor supply, individual wages, household unearned income, one assignable good, and consumption expenditure at the household level.",Yuk‐fai Fong,Junsen Zhang,,,,,

This paper develops a model of police and motorist behavior that suggests an empirical test for distinguishing whether this disparity is due to racial prejudice or to the police’s objective to maximize arrests. When applied to vehicle search data from Maryland, our test results are consistent with the hypothesis of no racial prejudice against African‐American motorists. However, if police have utility only for searches yielding large drug finds, then our analysis would suggest bias against white drivers. The model’s prediction regarding nonrace characteristics is also largely supported by the data.",John Knowles,Nicola Persico,Petra Todd,,,,

Emitters of the controlled pollutants in nonattainment counties were subject to greater regulatory oversight than emitters in attainment counties. The preferred statistical model for plant‐level growth includes plant fixed effects, industry by period fixed effects, and county by period fixed effects. The estimates from this model suggest that in the first 15 years in which the Clean Air Act was in force (1972–87), nonattainment counties (relative to attainment ones) lost approximately 590,000 jobs, $37 billion in capital stock, and $75 billion (1987 dollars) of output in pollution‐intensive industries.

To recover a version of Barro’s random walk tax‐smoothing outcome, we modify Lucas and Stokey’s economy to permit only risk‐free debt. Having only risk‐free debt confronts the Ramsey planner with additional constraints on equilibrium allocations beyond one imposed by Lucas and Stokey’s assumption of complete markets. The Ramsey outcome blends features of Barro’s model with Lucas and Stokey’s. In our model, the contemporaneous effects of exogenous government expenditures on the government deficit and taxes resemble those in Lucas and Stokey’s model, but incomplete markets put a near–unit root component into government debt and taxes, an outcome like Barro’s. However, we show that without ad hoc limits on the government’s asset holdings, outcomes can diverge in important ways from Barro’s.

While individual risk aversion does not change over time, dynamic redistribution of wealth among the agents leads to countercyclical time variation in the Sharpe ratio of stock returns. We show that both the conditional risk premium and the return volatility are negatively related to the level of stock prices.

However, there is very little experience with applying incentives in schools. This paper provides evidence on the causal effects of two programs: the first provided the school and its teachers with monetary performance incentives and the second with additional conventional resources. The assignment of schools to the two programs was not random; therefore, identification is a central issue in the empirical analysis. The empirical results suggest that schools’ and teachers’ group monetary incentives caused significant gains in many dimensions of students’ outcomes. Endowing schools with more resources also led to improvement in student performance. However, the comparison based on cost equivalency suggests that the teachers’ incentive intervention is much more cost effective.",Victor Lavy,,,,,,

At the same time, stable monthly earnings for minimum‐wage earners were mandated. We show that workers employed 40 hours and above in March 1981 were more likely to lose their jobs between 1981 and 1982 than workers employed 36–39 hours in March 1981. Moreover, many workers were still working 40 hours after February. These workers were also strongly affected by this reduction.

The development process depicted follows the Flying Geese pattern, in which a series of industries take off one after another. As productivity improves in these industries, each consumer good becomes affordable to an increasingly large number of households, which constantly expand the range of goods they consume. This in turn generates larger markets for consumer goods, which leads to further improvement in productivity.

When bad economic shocks are highly likely, state‐contingent debt moratoria always improve ex post efficiency and may also improve ex ante efficiency. Moreover, the threat of moratoria enhances efficiency.

We then construct estimates of the IMRS for each of these different groups and consider their time‐series properties. We find that the consumption growth of shareholders is more volatile than that of nonshareholders and more highly correlated with excess returns to shares.

Previous research has suggested that such discrete                     and occasional adjustments have significant aggregate implications. In                     particular, it has been argued that changes in plants’ willingness to                     invest in response to aggregate shocks can at times generate large movements in                     total investment demand. In this study, I reassess these predictions in a                     general equilibrium environment. Specifically, assuming nonconvex costs of                     capital adjustment, I derive generalized (S, s) adjustment                     rules yielding lumpy plant‐level investment within an otherwise standard                     equilibrium business cycle model. In contrast to previous partial equilibrium                     analyses, model results reveal that the aggregate effects of lumpy investment                     are negligible. In general equilibrium, households’ preference for                     relatively smooth consumption profiles offsets changes in aggregate investment                     demand implied by the introduction of lumpy plant‐level investment. As a                     result, adjustments in wages and interest rates yield quantity dynamics that are                     virtually indistinguishable from the standard model, and lumpy investment                     appears largely irrelevant for equilibrium business cycle analysis.",Julia K.

However, if the firm becomes bankrupt, investors may face uncertain costs of reorganizing assets in a foreign country and thus may value foreign assets at their average value. This penalizes superior firms with low reorganization costs. Such firms minimize the adverse selection penalty by designing securities that allocate all the cash flow in bankruptcy to investors for which the adverse selection costs are the smallest given the exchange rate. We show that this sharing rule can be implemented with currency swaps because these instruments allow the priorities of claims in bankruptcy to switch depending on the exchange rate.",Bhagwan Chowdhry,Mark Grinblatt,David Levine,,,,

It argues that the medieval Roman Catholic Church, through doctrinal manipulation, the exclusion of rivals, and various forms of price discrimination, ultimately placed members seeking the Z good “spiritual services” on the margin of defection. These monopolistic practices encouraged entry by rival firms, some of which were aligned with civil governments. The paper hypothesizes that Protestant entry was facilitated in emergent entrepreneurial societies characterized by the decline of feudalism and relatively unstable distribution of wealth and repressed in more homogeneous, rent‐seeking societies that were mostly dissipating rather than creating wealth. In these societies the Roman Church was more able to continue the practice of price discrimination. Informal tests of this proposition are conducted by considering primogeniture and urban growth as proxies for wealth stability.","Robert B. Ekelund, Jr.",Robert F. Hébert,Robert D. Tollison,,,,

In voting in favor of employment protection, incumbent employees trade off lower living standards (because employment protection maintains workers in less productive activities) against longer job duration. The latter is valued because the employed have rents, achieving wages above their alternative value. The gains from, and consequently the political support for, employment protection are larger the lower the rate of creative destruction (i.e., the lower the growth rate) and the larger the employed’s bargaining power. Hence, employment protection is more likely to arise in economies with greater worker bargaining power. Also, workers in older vintages are more in favor of employment protection. Consequently, greater initial protection increases its own support by maintaining a larger fraction of the workforce in older vintages. Finally, if workers can invest ex ante in match‐specific human capital, multiple steady‐state political equilibria may arise, as the outcome of the mutual feedback between employee rents and employment protection.",Gilles Saint‐Paul,,,,,,

Since versions of both theories can predict this equation, we tackle the model identification problem by conditioning bilateral trade relations on factor endowment differences and on the share of intraindustry trade. Only for large differences in factor endowments does the Heckscher‐Ohlin model predict perfect production specialization in different countries as well as the gravity equation, and trade is purely in goods produced with different factor intensities. Our empirical analysis yields three findings. First, the predictions of the perfect specialization versions of both theories are rejected by the data and so are unlikely explanations for the empirical success of the gravity equation. Second, a model of imperfect specialization that includes both increasing returns and factor endowments as sources of trade has a mixed performance: it correctly predicts production of more differentiated goods when the level of intraindustry trade is greater; however, the predicted link to factor proportions is tenuous. Third, the predictions of a model with imperfect specialization that relies solely on differences in factor endowments find support in the data. These results suggest that factor endowments and increasing returns explain different components of the international variation of production patterns and trade volumes.",Simon J.

We model the demand for currency accounting for adoption of new transaction technologies and the decision to hold interest‐bearing assets. The interest rate and expenditure flow elasticities of the demand for currency are close to the theoretical values implied by standard inventory models. However, we find significant differences between individuals with an ATM card and those without. The estimates of the demand for currency allow us to calculate a measure of the welfare cost of inflation analogous to Bailey’s triangle, but based on a rigorous microeconometric framework. The welfare cost of inflation varies considerably within the population but never turns out to be very large (about 0.1 percent of consumption or less). Our results are robust to various changes in the econometric specification.

The theoretical analysis shows that in an economy with an infinitely large number of donors, impurely altruistic preferences lead to either asymptotically zero or complete crowd‐out. The paper then establishes conditions on preferences that are sufficient to yield zero crowd‐out in the limit. These conditions are fairly weak and quite plausible. An empirical representation of the model is estimated using a new 1986–92 panel of donations and government funding from the United States to 125 international relief and development organizations. Besides directly linking sources of public and private support, the econometric analysis controls for unobserved institution‐specific factors, institution‐specific changes in leadership, year‐to‐year changes in need, and expenditures by related organizations. The estimates show little evidence of crowd‐out from either direct public or related private sources. Thus, at the margin, donations to these organizations appear to be motivated solely by joy‐of‐giving preferences. In addition to addressing the basic question of motives behind charitable giving, the results help explain the existing disparity between econometric and experimental crowd‐out estimates.",David C.

Under adverse selection instead, leasing contracts affect equilibrium allocations in a way that matches observed behavior in the car market. Consistent with the data, our model predicts that leased cars have a higher turnover and that off‐lease used cars are of higher quality. Moreover, the model predicts that the recent increase in leasing can be explained by the observed increase in car durability. We show that leasing contracts can improve welfare but that they are imperfect tools. We also show that a producer with market power can benefit from leasing contracts for two reasons: market segmentation and better pricing of the option. Moreover, despite the fact that lessors could structure contracts to prevent adverse selection, we show that this is not in their interest.",Igal Hendel,Alessandro Lizzeri,,,,,

With short‐sale constraints, an asset buyer acquires an option to sell the asset to other agents when those agents have more optimistic beliefs. As in a paper by Harrison and Kreps, agents pay prices that exceed their own valuation of future dividends because they believe that in the future they will find a buyer willing to pay even more. This causes a significant bubble component in asset prices even when small differences of beliefs are sufficient to generate a trade. In equilibrium, bubbles are accompanied by large trading volume and high price volatility. Our analysis shows that while Tobin’s tax can substantially reduce speculative trading when transaction costs are small, it has only a limited impact on the size of the bubble or on price volatility.",José A.

The main conclusion is that the decline in income inequality that took place during the first half of the century was mostly accidental.

Corporate Governance and Managerial Preferences,111,5,October,2003,"Much of our understanding of corporations builds on the idea that managers, when they are not closely monitored, will pursue goals that are not in shareholders’ interests. But what goals would managers pursue? This paper uses variation in corporate governance generated by state adoption of antitakeover laws to empirically map out managerial preferences. We use plant‐level data and exploit a unique feature of corporate law that allows us to deal with possible biases associated with the timing of the laws. We find that when managers are insulated from takeovers, worker wages (especially those of white‐collar workers) rise. The destruction of old plants falls, but the creation of new plants also falls. Finally, overall productivity and profitability decline in response to these laws. Our results suggest that active empire building may not be the norm and that managers may instead prefer to enjoy the quiet life.",Marianne Bertrand,Sendhil Mullainathan,,,,,

Fixed Commissions and Social Waste in the Real Estate Industry,111,5,October,2003,"Real estate agents typically charge a 6 percent commission, regardless of the price of the house sold. As a consequence, the commission fee from selling a house will differ dramatically across cities depending on the average price of housing, although the effort necessary to match buyers and sellers may not be that different. We use a simple economic model to show that if barriers to entry are low, the entry of real estate agents in cities with high housing prices is socially inefficient. Consistent with our model, we find that when the average price of land in a city increases, (1) the fraction of real estate brokers in a city increases, (2) the productivity of an average real estate agent (houses sold per hour worked) falls, and (3) the real wage of a typical real estate agent remains unchanged. We cannot completely rule out the alternative explanation that these results reflect unmeasured differences in the quality of broker services. However, we present evidence that as the average price of housing in a city increases, there is only a small increase in the amount of time a buyer spends searching for a house, and the average time a house for sale stays on the market falls.",Chang‐Tai Hsieh,Enrico Moretti,,,,,
https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/376951,Capture by Threat,111,5,October,2003,"We analyze a simple stochastic environment in which policy makers can be threatened by “nasty” interest groups. In the absence of these groups, the policy maker’s desire for reelection guarantees that good policies are implemented for every realization of the shock. When pressure groups can harass the policy maker, good policies will be chosen for only a subset of states of nature. Hence, honest and able leaders might implement bad policies, and needed reforms could be delayed. In order to make good policies more likely, the public will want to increase the cost of exerting pressure for “nasty groups” and provide rents to those in power. This last result can be used to explain the existence of political parties. They play a role resembling that of the supervisor in the literature on collusion in hierarchical agency. A rational public may also choose to ignore negative media reports on a politician’s personal life and, in general, elect “strong” political leaders. The prevalence of coercive methods of influence helps explain why countries may get to be governed by “inept politicians.”",Ernesto Dal Bó,Rafael Di Tella,,,,,

The cross‐sectional relations between firm characteristics and returns can subsist even after one controls for typical empirical estimates of beta.

Many prior studies have shown that general equilibrium interactions affect excess burden but have not appreciated the bias associated with ignoring these interactions or the quantitative importance of this bias.

This alternative formula captures interactions that the simple formula omits; as a result it is both unbiased and usually more accurate.",Lawrence H. Goulder,Roberton C. Williams III,,,,,

We test this prediction using data from Florida’s Family Transition Program, a randomized welfare reform experiment.

Whether report cards are good for patients and for society depends on whether their financial and health benefits outweigh their costs in terms of the quantity, quality, and appropriateness of medical treatment that they induce. Using national data on Medicare patients at risk for cardiac surgery, we find that cardiac surgery report cards in New York and Pennsylvania led both to selection behavior by providers and to improved matching of patients with hospitals. On net, this led to higher levels of resource use and to worse health outcomes, particularly for sicker patients.

Our monthly liquidity measure, an average of                     individual‐stock measures estimated with daily data, relies on the                     principle that order flow induces greater return reversals when liquidity is                     lower.

This paper explains the difference between these two experiences by focusing on the role played by caste. The theoretical model contrasts caste‐ and non‐caste‐based societies: in the former, there exists an inherited component to status (caste) that is independent of wealth, and in the latter, wealth is the primary determinant of status. Modernization is assumed to involve two components: increasing average wealth and increasing wealth dispersion within status (or caste) groups. The paper shows that, in caste‐based societies, the increases in wealth dispersion that accompany modernization necessarily lead to increases in dowry payments, whereas in non‐caste‐based societies, increased dispersion has no real effect on dowry payments and increasing average wealth causes the payments to decline.",Siwan Anderson,,,,,,

Input‐output relations                     provide an economic distance measure that is used to characterize interactions                     between sectors, as well as conduct estimation and inference. We construct two                     different economic distance measures. One metric implies that two sectors are                     close to one another if they use inputs of other industrial sectors in nearly                     the same proportion, and the other metric implies that sectors are close if                     their outputs are used by the same sectors. Our model holds that covariance in                     productivity growth across sectors is a function of economic distance.

Producers and consumers of a commodity (or buyers and sellers of an asset) who wish to trade can choose between two competing types of intermediaries: “middlemen” (dealer/brokers) and “market makers” (specialists). Market makers post publicly observable bid and ask prices, whereas the prices quoted by different middlemen are private information that can be obtained only through a costly search process. We consider an initial equilibrium with which there are no market makers but there is free entry of middlemen with heterogeneous transactions costs. We characterize conditions under which entry of a single market maker can be profitable even though it is common knowledge that all surviving middlemen will undercut the market maker’s publicly posted bid and ask prices in the postentry equilibrium. The market maker’s entry induces the surviving middlemen to reduce their bid‐ask spreads, and as a result, all producers and consumers who choose to participate in the market enjoy a strict increase in their expected gains from trade. When there is free entry into market making and search and transactions costs tend to zero, bid‐ask spreads of all market makers and middlemen are forced to zero, and a fully efficient Walrasian equilibrium outcome emerges.",John Rust,George Hall,,,,,

In practice, however, central banks typically defend pegs aggressively by raising short‐term interest rates. This paper analyzes the feasibility and optimality of raising interest rates to delay a potential BOP crisis. Interest rate policy works through two distinct channels. By raising demand for domestic, interest‐bearing liquid assets, higher interest rates tend to delay the crisis. Higher interest rates, however, increase public debt service and imply higher future inflation, which tends to bring forward the crisis. We show that, under certain conditions, it is feasible to delay the crisis, but raising interest rates beyond a certain point may actually hasten the crisis. A similar nonmonotonic relationship emerges between welfare and the increase in interest rates. It is thus optimal to engage in some active interest rate defense but only up to a certain point. In fact, there is a whole range of interest rate increases for which it is feasible to delay the crisis but not optimal to do so.",Amartya Lahiri,Carlos A. Végh,,,,,

The only Pareto‐efficient allocation reachable through the mechanism requires that all households honestly report the true value of their property. However, such honest reporting is not an equilibrium except in the extreme case in which the property values are identical for all households. Nevertheless, as the size of the society becomes large, the benefits from deviating from truthful reporting vanish, and all the nondegenerate equilibria of the mechanism are nearly truthful and approximately Pareto efficient.",Antonio Cabrales,Antoni Calvó‐Armengol,Matthew O.

Rather than relying on one stylized model to provide                     an exact interpretation of the data, we explore an incomplete model based on two                     simple assumptions: bidders neither bid more than their valuations nor let an                     opponent win at a price they would be willing to beat. Focusing on the symmetric                     independent private values paradigm, we show that this limited structure enables                     construction of informative bounds on the distribution function characterizing                     bidder demand, on the optimal reserve price, and on the effects of observable                     covariates on bidder valuations.

Two features of this growth present challenges to the standard trade models. First, the growth is generally thought to have been generated by falling tariff barriers worldwide. But tariff barriers have decreased by only about 11 percentage points since the early 1960s; the standard models cannot explain the growth of trade without assuming counterfactually large elasticities of substitution between goods. Second, tariff declines were much larger prior to the mid 1980s than after, and yet, trade growth was smaller in the earlier period than in the later period. The standard models have difficulty generating this nonlinear feature. This paper develops a two‐country dynamic Ricardian trade model that offers a resolution of these two puzzles. The key idea embedded in this model is vertical specialization, which occurs when countries specialize only in particular stages of a good’s production sequence. The model generates a nonlinear trade response to tariff reductions and can explain over 50 percent of the growth of trade. Finally, the model has important implications for the gains from trade.",Kei‐Mu Yi,,,,,,

We show, by examples, that under the so‐called “optimal contract,” the postdeposit game can have a run equilibrium.

This paper rationalizes the apparent effectiveness of this argument in both direct and indirect democracies. In direct democracies, a small degree of voter altruism leads to protection in the specific factors model when the import‐competing sector earns little. Similarly, voter altruism creates an incentive in representative democracies for self‐interested parties to present evidence to legislators on the income of import‐competing factors. This leads to a theory in which campaign contributions buy access to legislators rather than buy votes.",Julio J. Rotemberg,,,,,,

This paper examines this question empirically. The analytical framework involves a general equilibrium model of preferential trade and an econometric model with tight links to this theory. This framework is used to implement tests of the natural trading partners hypothesis using U.S. trade data for the years 1964–95: Welfare changes that would result from preferential tariff reductions by the United States against various trading partners are first estimated, and correlations with bilateral “distance” measures (with and without controls for income levels) are then examined. Since the argument for “natural” trading partners is based on the greater likelihood of geographically proximate countries to be more significant trading partners, correlations between the welfare change estimates and bilateral trade volume are examined as well. Both geographic proximity and trade volume are found to have no effect. Thus this paper is unable to find any support for the natural trading partners theory in U.S. data.",Pravin Krishna,,,,,,

https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/424743,Market Structure and Productivity: A Concrete Example,112,6,December,2004,"Many studies have documented large and persistent productivity differences across producers, even within narrowly defined industries. This paper both extends and departs from the past literature, which focused on technological explanations for these differences, by proposing that demand‐side features also play a role in creating the observed productivity variation. The specific mechanism investigated here is the effect of spatial substitutability in the product market. When producers are densely clustered in a market, it is easier for consumers to switch between suppliers (making the market in a certain sense more competitive). Relatively inefficient producers find it more difficult to operate profitably as a result. Increases in substitutability truncate the productivity distribution from below, resulting in higher minimum and average productivity levels as well as less productivity dispersion. The paper presents a model that makes this process explicit and empirically tests it using data from U.S. ready‐mixed concrete plants, taking advantage of geographic variation in substitutability created by the industry’s high transport costs. The results support the model’s predictions and appear robust. Markets with high demand density for ready‐mixed concrete—and thus high concrete plant densities—have higher lower‐bound and average productivity levels and exhibit less productivity dispersion among their producers.",Chad Syverson,,,,,,

Within a narrowly defined commodity classification, exporters charge destination‐varying prices that covary positively with shipping costs and negatively with tariffs.

The prevalence of small farms in the 1930s limited private solutions for controlling the downwind externalities associated with wind erosion. Drifting sand from unprotected fields damaged neighboring farms. Small farmers cultivated more of their land and were less likely to invest in erosion control than larger farmers.

The intuition is that the durable good monopolist initially announces high future prices to get high‐valuation buyers to buy early and subsequently lowers the price to attract additional buyers. On the other hand, the monopsonist buyer of the exhaustible resource initially announces low future prices to encourage sellers to supply their units early and subsequently, as the stock of the resource declines, raises the price to call forth additional supply.

We consider whether a long, contentious strike and the hiring of                     replacement workers at Bridgestone/Firestone’s Decatur, Illinois, plant in                     the mid‐1990s contributed to the production of defective tires. Using                     several independent data sources and looking before and after the strike and                     across plants, we find that labor strife at the Decatur plant closely coincided                     with lower product quality.

Love, however, can complicate the picture. If love is                     fleeting or the resolution of agents’ income uncertainty occurs                     predominantly later in life, then marriages with good economic matches last                     longer. In contrast, if love is persistent and the resolution of uncertainty to                     agents’ income occurs early, then marriages with good economic matches are                     more likely to be caught short with too little love to save a marriage.                     Consequently, once married, the partners will be more likely to divorce.                     Evidence is provided to distinguish between these alternative scenarios.",Gregory D. Hess,,,,,,

The relationship between wealth and entry into entrepreneurship is essentially flat over the majority of the wealth distribution. It is only at the top of the wealth distribution—after the ninety‐fifth percentile—that a positive relationship can be found. Segmenting businesses into industries with high– and low–starting capital requirements, we find no evidence that wealth matters more for businesses requiring higher initial capital. When using inheritances as an instrument for wealth, we find that both past and future inheritances predict current business entry, showing that inheritances capture more than simply liquidity. We further exploit the regional variation in house prices and find that households that lived in regions in which housing prices appreciated strongly were no more likely to start a business than households in other regions.",Erik Hurst,Annamaria Lusardi,,,,,

We resolve this long‐standing question using new empirical methods applied to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, the Survey of Consumer Finances, and the Consumer Expenditure Survey. We find a strong positive relationship between saving rates and lifetime income and a weaker but still positive relationship between the marginal propensity to save and lifetime income. There is little support for theories that seek to explain these positive correlations by relying solely on time preference rates, nonhomothetic preferences, or variations in Social Security benefits. There is more support for models emphasizing uncertainty with respect to income and health expenses, bequest motives, and asset‐based means testing or behavioral factors causing minimal saving rates among low‐income households.",Karen E.

We find strong support for the proposition that both judicial independence and constitutional review are associated with greater freedom. Consistent with theory, judicial independence accounts for some of the positive effect of common‐law legal origin on measures of economic freedom.

We quantify the effects of tax rates on tax evasion by examining the relationship in China between the tariff schedule and the “evasion gap,” which we define as the difference between Hong Kong’s reported exports to China at the product level and China’s reported imports from Hong Kong. Our results imply that a one‐percentage‐point increase in the tax rate is associated with a 3 percent increase in evasion. Furthermore, the evasion gap is negatively correlated with tax rates on closely related products, suggesting that evasion takes place partly through misclassification of imports from higher‐taxed categories to lower‐taxed ones, in addition to underreporting the value of imports.",Raymond Fisman,Shang‐Jin Wei,,,,,

We establish that in an additive version of the hedonic model, technology and preferences are generically nonparametrically identified from data on demand and supply in a single hedonic market. The empirical literature that claims that hedonic models estimated on data from a single market are fundamentally underidentified is based on arbitrary linearizations that do not use all the information in the model. The exact economic model that justifies linear approximations is unappealing. Nonlinearities are generic features of equilibrium in hedonic models and a fundamental and economically motivated source of identification.",Ivar Ekeland,James J. Heckman,Lars Nesheim,,,,

The model is largely successful in understanding data in the U.S. engineering labor market. The engineering market responds strongly to economic forces. The demand for engineers responds to the price of engineering services and demand shifters. More important, supply and enrollment decisions are remarkably sensitive to career prospects in engineering. Also a rational model, in which students use some forward‐looking elements to forecast future demand for engineers, fits the data reasonably well. These findings suggest that subsidies to build technical talent ahead of demand are misplaced unless public policy makers have better information on future market conditions than the market participants do.",Jaewoo Ryoo,Sherwin Rosen,,,,,
https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/379943,The Peter Principle: A Theory of Decline,112,S1,February,2004,"Some have observed that individuals perform worse after being promoted. The Peter principle, which states that people are promoted to their level of incompetence, suggests that something is fundamentally misaligned in the promotion process. This view is unnecessary and inconsistent with the data. Below, it is argued that ability appears lower after promotion purely as a statistical matter. Being promoted is evidence that a standard has been met. Regression to the mean implies that future ability will be lower, on average. Firms optimally account for the regression bias in making promotion decisions, but the effect is never eliminated. Rather than evidence of a mistake, the Peter principle is a necessary consequence of any promotion rule. Furthermore, firms that take it into account appropriately adopt an optimal strategy. Usually, firms inflate the promotion criterion to offset the Peter principle effect, and the more important the transitory component is relative to total variation in ability, the larger the amount that the standard is inflated. The same logic applies to other situations. For example, it explains why movie sequels are worse than the original film on which they are based and why second visits to restaurants are less rewarding than the first.",Edward P. Lazear,,,,,,
https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/380085,Save More Tomorrow™: Using Behavioral Economics to Increase Employee Saving,112,S1,February,2004,"As firms switch from defined‐benefit plans to defined‐contribution plans, employees bear more responsibility for making decisions about how much to save. The employees who fail to join the plan or who participate at a very low level appear to be saving at less than the predicted life cycle savings rates. Behavioral explanations for this behavior stress bounded rationality and self‐control and suggest that at least some of the low‐saving households are making a mistake and would welcome aid in making decisions about their saving. In this paper, we propose such a prescriptive savings program, called Save More Tomorrow™ (hereafter, the SMarT program). The essence of the program is straightforward: people commit in advance to allocating a portion of their future salary increases toward retirement savings. We report evidence on the first three implementations of the SMarT program. Our key findings, from the first implementation, which has been in place for four annual raises, are as follows: (1) a high proportion (78 percent) of those offered the plan joined, (2) the vast majority of those enrolled in the SMarT plan (80 percent) remained in it through the fourth pay raise, and (3) the average saving rates for SMarT program participants increased from 3.5 percent to 13.6 percent over the course of 40 months.

Market equilibrium can be “separating,” with multiple sellers and a sorting of heterogeneous consumers across goods, or “exclusionary,” with one seller serving all customer types. Entry into an initially monopolized market can occur because of cost reductions or product improvements, but entry need not lower the incumbent’s price, improve efficiency, or raise consumer welfare. Postentry design incentives favor a softening of price competition and stronger market segmentation, whereas exclusionary design changes typically raise consumer welfare.

Since the states that adopted the higher speed limit must have valued the travel hours they saved more than the fatalities incurred, this institutional change provides an opportunity to estimate an upper bound on the public’s willingness to trade off wealth for a change in the probability of death. Our estimates indicate that the adoption of the 65‐mph limit increased speeds by approximately 4 percent, or 2.5 mph, and fatality rates by roughly 35 percent. Together, the estimates suggest that about 125,000 hours were saved per lost life. When the time saved is valued at the average hourly wage, the estimates imply that adopting states were willing to accept risks that resulted in a savings of $1.54 million (1997 dollars) per fatality, with a sampling error roughly one‐third this value. We set out a simple model of states' decisions to adopt the 65‐mph limit that turns on whether their savings exceed their value of a statistical life. The empirical implementation of this model supports the claim that $1.54 million is an upper bound, but it provides imprecise estimates of the value of a statistical life.",Orley Ashenfelter,Michael Greenstone,,,,,

The joint venture we examine is the National Hockey League (NHL) in the 1980s, which was then composed of 21 separately owned teams. (It now has 30 teams.) The restriction we analyze is the NHL rule on franchise relocation. Before one can fully understand the effect of the restriction, one must understand the theory of how sports leagues operate and whether sports leagues have any market power that can be enhanced by such a restriction. After providing such a theory, we empirically test the effect of the NHL restriction on franchise relocation. Aside from data availability, the advantage of our time period is that television was then an unimportant source of revenue for the NHL. Thus we are able to isolate a particular externality arising from how the NHL finances teams.",Dennis W. Carlton,Alan S. Frankel,Elisabeth M. Landes,,,,

We focus on the determinants (demand elasticities, persistence of technology change, etc.) of the severity of the has‐beens effect. It can be large, even leading to negatively sloped within‐occupation age‐earnings profiles and an occupation dominated by a few young, high‐income workers.

Empirical identification of borrowing constraints is secured by the                     economic prediction that opportunity costs and direct costs of schooling affect                     borrowing‐constrained and unconstrained persons differently. Direct costs                     need to be financed during school and impose a larger burden on                     credit‐constrained students. By contrast, gross forgone earnings do not                     have to be financed. We explore the implications of this idea using four                     methodologies: schooling attainment models, instrumental variable wage                     regressions, and two structural economic models that integrate both schooling                     choices and schooling returns into a unified framework. None of the methods                     produces evidence that borrowing constraints generate inefficiencies in the                     market for schooling in the current policy environment.

This evidence includes both cross‐country analyses and a natural experiment based on recent vaccination campaigns. Hepatitis B is common in many Asian countries, especially China, where some 10–15 percent of the population is infected.

It is also the poorest region of the world. In this paper I ask whether banning polygyny could play any role for development. Using a quantitative model of polygyny, I find that enforcing monogamy lowers fertility, shrinks the spousal age gap, and reverses the direction of marriage payments. Polygyny leads to high bride‐prices to “ration” women, which makes buying wives and selling daughters a good investment, thus crowding out investment in physical assets. For reasonable parameter values, I find that banning polygyny decreases fertility by 40 percent, increases savings by 70 percent, and increases output per capita by 170 percent.",Michèle Tertilt,,,,,,

We show that this is matched by an equally dramatic rise in                     time spent shopping for and preparing meals. Using a novel data set that                     collects detailed food diaries for a large cross section of U.S. households, we                     show that neither the quality nor the quantity of food intake deteriorates with                     retirement status. We also show that unemployed households experience a decline                     in food expenditure and food consumption commensurate with the impact of job                     displacement on permanent income.

The present paper considers the case of a small buyer who cannot commit to a mechanism. It develops a simple sequential procurement model and investigates its equilibria and welfare optima.

The U.S. and Canadian iron ore industries faced a major crisis that cast doubt on their future. In response to the crisis, these industries dramatically increased productivity. Labor productivity doubled in a few years (whereas it had changed little in the preceding decade). Materials productivity increased by more than half. Capital productivity increased as well.

An exogenous institutional rule prescribes which moves from one state to another are feasible to each coalition. At each time, an agent is called to act with some exogenous probability, and he chooses a coalition, a feasible new state to move the economy to, and side payments between the agents in the coalition. The setup can be applied to various dynamic processes of social and economic interactions such as legislative bargaining, coalition formation, or exchange economies. Whenever agents are unable to write long‐term contracts, but are otherwise unconstrained both in their ability to write arbitrary spot contracts and in their ability to collude, there can be long‐run inefficiencies (with cycles or inefficient steady states). However, when agents are sufficiently patient, the initial state from which the process starts plays no role in the long run. Moreover, when there exists an efficient state that is free of negative externalities (in the sense that a move away from that state does not hurt the agents whose consent is not required for the move), the system must converge to this efficient state in the long run. It is thus more important to design institutions guaranteeing the existence of an efficient negative externality–free state than to implement a fine initialization of the process.",Armando Gomes,Philippe Jehiel,,,,,

Evidence from the Housing Market,113,2,April,2005,"We exploit the structure of the Clean Air Act to provide new evidence on the capitalization of total suspended particulates (TSPs) air pollution into housing values. This legislation imposes strict regulations on polluters in “nonattainment” counties, which are defined by concentrations of TSPs that exceed a federally set ceiling. TSPs nonattainment status is associated with large reductions in TSPs pollution and increases in county‐level housing prices. When nonattainment status is used as an instrumental variable for TSPs, we find that the elasticity of housing values with respect to particulates concentrations ranges from −0.20 to −0.35. These estimates of the average marginal willingness to pay for clean air are robust to quasi‐experimental regression discontinuity and matching specification tests. Further, they are far less sensitive to model specification than cross‐sectional and fixed‐effects estimates, which occasionally have the “perverse” sign. We also find modest evidence that the marginal benefit of reductions of TSPs is lower in communities with relatively high pollution levels, which is consistent with preference‐based sorting. Overall, the improvements in air quality induced by the mid‐1970s TSPs nonattainment designation are associated with a $45 billion aggregate increase in housing values in nonattainment counties between 1970 and 1980.",Kenneth Y.

One important proposal under discussion is whether to privatize water provision. In the 1990s Argentina embarked on one of the largest privatization campaigns in the world, including the privatization of local water companies covering approximately 30 percent of the country’s municipalities. Using the variation in ownership of water provision across time and space generated by the privatization process, we find that child mortality fell 8 percent in the areas that privatized their water services and that the effect was largest (26 percent) in the poorest areas. We check the robustness of these estimates using cause‐specific mortality. While privatization is associated with significant reductions in deaths from infectious and parasitic diseases, it is uncorrelated with deaths from causes unrelated to water conditions.",Sebastian Galiani,Paul Gertler,Ernesto Schargrodsky,,,,

Because we do not have a good                     instrumental variable for Catholic school attendance, we develop new estimation                     methods based on the idea that the amount of selection on the observed                     explanatory variables in a model provides a guide to the amount of selection on                     the unobservables.

Lately, the focus has been on Hume’s alleged misapplication of the quantity theory of money. While he appears to subscribe to a simple quantity theory with money neutrality, in a famously contested passage in the essay Of Money, he violates the neutrality condition by claiming that an increase in the money stock has favorable output effects. While most commentators argue about the persistence of the output effect, this paper suggests that we can derive an alternative understanding of Hume’s monetary thinking by recognizing that he made an analytical distinction between endogenous and exogenous money. Realization that only the former has a favorable output effect forces us to overturn the long‐standing consensus that Hume instructed the government to use monetary or trade policy to engineer a gradually increasing money stock.",Carl Wennerlind,,,,,,

We study the optimal reward policy when the quality of the ideas and their subsequent development effort are private information. Monopoly power is a scarce resource to be allocated across innovators who arrive at various times. The optimal assignment of property rights must counterbalance the incentives of current and future innovators. The resulting mechanism resembles a menu of patents that have infinite duration and fixed scope. This optimal patent menu can be implemented with a simple buyout scheme: The innovator commits at the outset to a price ceiling at which he will sell his rights to a future inventor. When a larger fee is paid initially, a higher price ceiling is obtained. Any subsequent innovator must pay this price and purchase his own buyout fee contract. We relate this mechanism to the proposed compulsory licensing schemes.",Hugo Hopenhayn,Gerard Llobet,Matthew Mitchell,,,,

Besides transferring resources from the old to the young, inflation is a boon for the government and a tax on foreigners.

Productivity becomes observable to firms after assessing their workers on the job, but it is not verifiable. Firms with vacancies choose between posting a noncontingent wage and leaving wages subject to bargaining with the worker. Under wage bargaining, firms cannot optimize the trade‐off between paying higher wages and having a larger probability of filling vacancies. But wage bargaining makes wages increasing in worker productivity and so may allow firms to attract better workers into the vacancy. When workers’ heterogeneity is large and bargaining powers come close to satisfying Hosios’s rule, firms opt for bargaining. Yet, equilibria with bargaining fail to maximize aggregate net income and sometimes are not constrained Pareto optimal.",Claudio Michelacci,Javier Suarez,,,,,

Matching is positively assortative—higher types match with higher sets of types—when the proportionate gains from having better partners rise in one’s type. With multiplicatively separable payoffs, these proportionate gains are constant in one’s type, and “block segregation” arises, a common finding of the literature.",Lones Smith,,,,,,

If there are placebo effects, patients in the higher‐probability trial will experience better outcomes simply because they believe that there is a greater chance of receiving treatment. This paper finds evidence of placebo effects in trials of antiulcer and cholesterol‐lowering drugs.",Anup Malani,,,,,,

An optimum is implemented by an asset‐tested disability system in which a disability transfer is paid only if an agent has assets below a specified maximum. The logic behind this result is that an agent who plans to falsely claim disability (a) finds doing so unattractive if he does not adjust his savings and (b) cannot collect disability insurance if he does adjust his savings in the desired direction (upward). For a calibrated economy, we find that welfare gains from asset testing are significant.",Mikhail Golosov,Aleh Tsyvinski,,,,,
https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/499414,Media Bias and Reputation,114,2,April,2006,A Bayesian consumer who is uncertain about the quality of an information source will infer that the source is of higher quality when its reports conform to the consumer’s prior expectations. We use this fact to build a model of media bias in which firms slant their reports toward the prior beliefs of their customers in order to build a reputation for quality. Bias emerges in our model even though it can make all market participants worse off. The model predicts that bias will be less severe when consumers receive independent evidence on the true state of the world and that competition between independently owned news outlets can reduce bias. We present a variety of empirical evidence consistent with these predictions.,Matthew Gentzkow,Jesse M. Shapiro,,,,,

This study designs a field experiment that is explicitly linked to a controlled laboratory experiment to examine whether, and to what extent, social preferences influence outcomes in actual market transactions. While agents drawn from a well‐functioning marketplace behave in accord with social preference models in tightly controlled laboratory experiments, when they are observed in their naturally occurring settings, their behavior approaches what is predicted by self‐interest theory. In the limit, much of the observed behavior in the marketplace that is consistent with social preferences is due to reputational concerns: suppliers who expect to have future interactions with buyers provide higher product quality only when the buyer can verify quality via a third‐party certifier. The data also speak to theories of how reputation effects enhance market performance. In particular, reputation and the monitoring of quality are found to be complements, and findings suggest that the private market can solve the lemons problem through third‐party verification.",John A.

We use illegal drugs as a prominent example. We show that the more inelastic either demand for or supply of a good is, the greater the increase in social cost from further reducing its production by greater enforcement efforts. So optimal public expenditures on apprehension and conviction of illegal suppliers depend not only on the difference between the social and private values from consumption but also on these elasticities. When demand and supply are not too elastic, it does not pay to enforce any prohibition unless the social value is negative. We also show that a monetary tax could cause a greater reduction in output and increase in price than optimal enforcement against the same good would if it were illegal, even though some producers may go underground to avoid a monetary tax. When enforcement is costly, excise taxes and quantity restrictions are not equivalent.",Gary S. Becker,Kevin M. Murphy,Michael Grossman,,,,

I use store‐level price data on 915 consumer price index products to show that the increase in aggregate demand prompted by the arrival of the FSU immigration significantly reduced prices during 1990. When one controls for native population size and city and month effects, a one‐percentage‐point increase in the ratio of immigrants to natives in a city decreases prices by 0.5 percentage point on average. It is argued that this negative immigration effect is consistent with FSU immigrants—the new consumers—having higher price elasticities and lower search costs than the native population.

It embeds a boundary                     discontinuity design in a heterogeneous residential choice model, addressing the                     endogeneity of school and neighborhood characteristics. The model is estimated                     using restricted‐access Census data from a large metropolitan area,                     yielding a number of new results. First, households are willing to pay less than                     1 percent more in house prices—substantially lower than previous                     estimates—when the average performance of the local school increases by 5                     percent. Second, much of the apparent willingness to pay for more educated and                     wealthier neighbors is explained by the correlation of these sociodemographic                     measures with unobserved neighborhood quality. Third, neighborhood race is not                     capitalized directly into housing prices; instead, the negative correlation of                     neighborhood percent black and housing prices is due entirely to the fact that                     blacks live in unobservably lower‐quality neighborhoods. Finally, there                     is considerable heterogeneity in preferences for schools and neighbors, with                     households preferring to self‐segregate on the basis of both race and                     education.",Patrick Bayer,Fernando Ferreira,Robert McMillan,,,,

Default cycles occur endogenously over time along every equilibrium path. After a sequence of bad shocks, the borrower in a competitive market accumulates debt so large that the incumbent lenders exercise monopoly power. Even though the incumbents could maintain this power forever, they find it profitable to let the borrower regain access to the competitive market after a sequence of good shocks. Equilibria are computed numerically, and their attributes are qualitatively consistent with numerous known empirical facts on sovereign lending. In addition, the model predicts that a borrower who accumulates debt overhang will regain access to the competitive credit market only after good shocks. This prediction is shown to be consistent with data on emerging market economies.",Natalia Kovrijnykh,Balázs Szentes,,,,,

The action set variation includes choices in which the dictator can “take” money from the other player. Empirical results question the received interpretation of dictator game giving: many fewer agents are willing to transfer money when the action set includes taking. Yet, a result that holds regardless of action set composition is that agents do not ubiquitously choose the most selfish outcome.

Sellers can change price only by incurring a real “menu cost.” We calibrate this cost and the variance and autocorrelation of the idiosyncratic shock using a new U.S. data set of individual prices due to Klenow and Kryvtsov. The prediction of the calibrated model for the effects of high inflation on the frequency of price changes accords well with international evidence from various studies. The model is also used to conduct numerical experiments on the economy’s response to various shocks. In none of the simulations we conducted did monetary shocks induce large or persistent real responses.,Mikhail Golosov,Robert E. Lucas Jr.,,,,,

By contrast, increasing grassroots participation in monitoring had little average impact, reducing missing expenditures only in situations with limited free‐rider problems and limited elite capture. Overall, the results suggest that traditional top‐down monitoring can play an important role in reducing corruption, even in a highly corrupt environment.",Benjamin A. Olken,,,,,,

It uses a rich data set of cement and ready‐mixed concrete plants that spans several decades to perform a detailed case study. There is little evidence that foreclosure is quantitatively important in these industries. Instead, prices fall, quantities rise, and entry rates remain unchanged when markets become more integrated. These patterns are consistent, however, with an alternative efficiency‐based mechanism. Namely, higher‐productivity producers are more likely to vertically integrate and are also larger, more likely to survive, and more likely to charge lower prices. We find evidence that integrated producers’ productivity advantage is tied to improved logistics coordination afforded by large local concrete operations. Interestingly, this benefit is not due to firms’ vertical structures per se: nonvertical firms with large local concrete operations have similarly high productivity levels.",Ali Hortaçsu,Chad Syverson,,,,,

For distributions that have an increasing failure rate (IFR), a proliferation of status classes is optimal, whereas the optimal partition involves only two categories if the distribution of abilities is sufficiently concave. Moreover, for IFR distributions, a coarse partition with two status categories achieves at least half of the output obtained in the optimal partition with many categories. Finally, if status is derived solely from monetary rewards, we show that the optimal partition in status classes contains only two categories.",Benny Moldovanu,Aner Sela,Xianwen Shi,,,,

While this question is receiving considerable attention in academia, industry, and Congress, we are the first to study the phenomenon employing data on actual downloads of music files. We match an extensive sample of downloads to U.S. sales data for a large number of albums. To establish causality, we instrument for downloads using data on international school holidays.

Diesel fuel used for on‐road purposes is taxed, while other uses are untaxed, creating an incentive for firms and individuals to evade on‐road diesel taxes by purchasing untaxed diesel fuel and then using it for on‐road use. We examine the effects of a federal regulatory innovation in October 1993, the addition of red dye to untaxed diesel fuel at the point of distribution, which significantly lowered the cost of regulatory enforcement. We find that sales of diesel fuel rose 26 percent following the regulatory change, while sales of heating oil, which is an untaxed perfect substitute, fell by a similar amount. The effect on sales was higher in states with higher tax rates and in states likely to have higher audit costs. We also find evidence that heating oil sales were less responsive to demand factors, such as temperature, prior to the dye program, indicating that a significant fraction of predye sales was illegitimate. Furthermore, we find a pattern of price and tax elasticities consistent with innovation in new evasion techniques subsequent to the regulatory change.

The empirical work establishes two results. First, hours worked in Europe decline by almost 45 percent compared to the United States over this period. Second, this decline is almost entirely accounted for by the fact that Europe develops a much smaller market service sector than the United States. A simple model of time allocation is used to understand these patterns. I find that relative increases in taxes and technological catch‐up can account for most of the differences between the European and American time allocations over this period.",Richard Rogerson,,,,,,

Measuring Long‐Run Risk,116,2,April,2008,We characterize and measure a long‐term risk‐return trade‐off for the valuation of cash flows exposed to fluctuations in macroeconomic growth. This trade‐off features risk prices of cash flows that are realized far into the future but continue to be reflected in asset values. We apply this analysis to claims on aggregate cash flows and to cash flows from value and growth portfolios by imputing values to the long‐run dynamic responses of cash flows to macroeconomic shocks. We explore the sensitivity of our results to features of the economic valuation model and of the model cash flow dynamics.,Lars Peter Hansen,John C. Heaton,Nan Li,,,,

It is shown that the first‐best allocation is implementable under the stricter notion without taxation if people are sufficiently patient.

Economic theory predicts that the entire subsidy incidence should be on the farmland owners. Using a complementary set of policy quasi experiments, I find that farmers who rent the land they cultivate capture 75 percent of the subsidy, leaving just 25 percent for landowners. This finding contradicts the prediction from neoclassical models. The standard prediction may not hold because of less than perfect competition in the farmland rental market; the share captured by landowners increases with local measures of competitiveness in the farmland rental market.",Barrett E.

Neoclassical explanations of this phenomenon focus on rational gamblers who overbet long shots because of risk-love. The competing behavioral explanations emphasize the role of misperceptions of probabilities. We provide novel empirical tests that can discriminate between these competing theories by assessing whether the models that explain gamblers’ choices in one part of their choice set (betting to win) can also rationalize decisions over a wider choice set, including compound bets in the exacta, quinella, or trifecta pools.

This yields two new stochastic orders: “wealth-uniform dominance” and “utility-uniform dominance.” Unlike stochastic dominance, these two orders are complete: any two gambles can be compared.

Authorities may not want to stand by and watch banks collapse. However, unconstrained direct bailouts undermine the disciplinary role of deposits. Moreover, competition forces banks to promise depositors more, increasing intervention and making the system worse off. By contrast, constrained central bank intervention to lower rates maintains private discipline, while offsetting contractual rigidity. It may still lead banks to make excessive liquidity promises. Anticipating this, central banks should raise rates in normal times to offset distortions from reducing rates in adverse times.",Douglas W. Diamond,Raghuram G. Rajan,,,,,

The full potential of this incentives program is not utilized because of the ROTC’s deficient matching mechanism.

We propose a simple model that captures these features, conveying new insights. A firm’s price can deflect or draw attention to its market, and consequently, limited attention introduces a new dimension of cross-market competition. We characterize the equilibrium and show that having partially attentive consumers improves consumer welfare. With less attention, consumers are more likely to miss the best offers; but enhanced cross-market competition decreases average price paid, as leading firms try to stay under the consumers’ radar.",Geoffroy de Clippel,Kfir Eliaz,Kareen Rozen,,,,

We show that entrepreneurs sacrifice current consumption in the hope of future success that never materializes for the bottom 25 percent, but entrepreneurship is a path toward great wealth and high consumption for the top quartile.",Neus Herranz,Stefan Krasa,Anne P.

Consequently, high-order moments are unlikely to exist, and the generalized method of moments estimation of Euler equations that employs cross-sectional moments may be inconsistent. Through bootstrap studies, we find that the power law appears to generate spurious nonrejection of heterogeneous-agent asset pricing models in explaining the equity premium.

https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/686732,Understanding Booms and Busts in Housing Markets,124,4,August,2016,Some booms in housing prices are followed by busts. Others are not. It is generally difficult to find observable fundamentals that are useful for predicting whether a boom will turn into a bust or not. We develop a model consistent with these observations. Agents have heterogeneous expectations about long-run fundamentals but change their views because of “social dynamics.” Agents with tighter priors are more likely to convert others to their beliefs. Boom-bust episodes typically occur when skeptical agents happen to be correct. The booms that are not followed by busts typically occur when optimistic agents happen to be correct.,Craig Burnside,Martin Eichenbaum,Sergio Rebelo,,,,

The endogeneity of the status quo exacerbates the players’ conflict of interest: Players disagree more often than under exogenous status quo. This leads to inefficiencies and status quo inertia. Under certain conditions, the negotiations can come to a complete gridlock: Players never reach an agreement. Gridlock can occur between players with arbitrarily similar preferences, provided they are sufficiently patient. In legislative settings, our model predicts polarization and explains why legislators may fail to react promptly to economic shocks.",Wioletta Dziuda,Antoine Loeper,,,,,

When a firm increases its workforce, it raises demand and weakens competition facing other firms, as employed workers spend more and have less time to search for low prices than unemployed workers. These effects induce other firms to hire more labor in order to scale up their presence in the product market.

Evidence on spending, shopping, and prices suggests that this is the case.",Greg Kaplan,Guido Menzio,,,,,

Competition for talent leads to an escalation of performance pay, shifting effort away from long-term investments, risk management, and cooperation. Efficiency losses can exceed those from a single principal, who dulls incentives to extract rents. As competition intensifies, monopsonistic underincentivization of low-skill agents first decreases and then gives way to growing overincentivization of high-skill ones. Aggregate welfare is thus hill-shaped, while inequality tends to rise monotonically. Bonus caps can help restore balance in incentives but may generate other distortions.",Roland Bénabou,Jean Tirole,,,,,

Using a regression discontinuity design (RDD), we estimate marginal effects of maximum duration on UI and nonemployment spells of 0.45 and 0.25, respectively. We simulate the unemployment rate implied by the RDD estimates assuming no market-level externalities. The implied response closely approximates the decline in the unemployment rate following the benefit cut, suggesting that, even in a period of high unemployment, the labor market absorbed the influx of workers without crowding out other job seekers.",Andrew C.

However, in several recent cases cartels have instead worked to preserve the privacy of their participants’ actions and outcomes. Toward explaining this behavior, we show that cartels can sometimes sustain higher profits when actions and outcomes are observed only privately, because better information can hinder collusion by helping firms devise more profitable deviations from the collusive agreement. We provide conditions under which maintaining privacy is optimal for cartels that follow a market-segmentation strategy.",Takuo Sugaya,Alexander Wolitzky,,,,,

We estimate a model in which strategic judges communicate before casting their votes and then compare the probability of mistakes in the court with deliberation with a counterfactual of no communication. The model has multiple equilibria, and preferences and information parameters are only partially identified. We find that there is a range of parameters in the identified set—when judges tend to disagree ex ante or their private information is imprecise—in which deliberation can be beneficial; otherwise, deliberation reduces the effectiveness of the court.",Matias Iaryczower,Xiaoxia Shi,Matthew Shum,,,,

We construct a dynamic general equilibrium model with several mechanisms that could generate declining goods-sector employment: foreign borrowing, nonhomothetic preferences, and differential productivity growth across sectors. We find that only 15.1 percent of the decline in goods-sector employment from 1992 to 2012 stems from US trade deficits; most of the decline is due to differential productivity growth. As the United States repays its debt, its trade balance will reverse, but goods-sector employment will continue to fall.",Timothy J. Kehoe,Kim J. Ruhl,Joseph B. Steinberg,,,,

Our main finding is that experience-wage profiles are on average twice as steep in rich countries as in poor countries. In addition, more educated workers have steeper profiles than the less educated; this accounts for around one-third of cross-country differences in aggregate profiles. Our findings are consistent with theories in which workers in poor countries accumulate less human capital or face greater search frictions over the life cycle.",David Lagakos,Benjamin Moll,Tommaso Porzio,Nancy Qian,Todd Schoellman,,

With buyer power, a merger increases incentives for entry, increases investment incentives for rivals, and can increase investment incentives for merging parties. Because buyer power reduces the profitability of a merger, it increases the profitability of perfect collusion relative to a merger.

To qualify the empirical evidence, we develop a theoretical model of strategic tax setting by local governments that anticipate the effects of taxes on the per capita income and the median “hedonic” income, two inextricable consequences of the sorting of heterogeneous individuals.",Beatrix Eugster,Raphaël Parchet,,,,,

We characterize the unique equilibrium and use our characterization to explore the interaction between adverse selection, screening, and imperfect competition. We show that the relationship between an agent’s type, the quantity he trades, and the price he pays is jointly determined by the severity of adverse selection and the concentration of market power. Therefore, quantifying the effects of adverse selection requires controlling for market structure. We also show that increasing competition and reducing informational asymmetries can decrease welfare.",Benjamin Lester,Ali Shourideh,Venky Venkateswaran,Ariel Zetlin-Jones,,,

We illustrate that this strong outside option improves physicians’ bargaining power with insurers.

This characterization generates predictions regarding the use of strategic investments—for example, in defense systems. An extension of the model shows how expanding one’s territory today may increase the risk of conflict tomorrow.",Sandeep Baliga,Tomas Sjöström,,,,,

The Age Profile of Bargaining Power and Poverty,128,7,July,2020,"Almost half of missing women in India are of postreproductive ages. Can intrahousehold gender inequality and asymmetry in poverty explain a portion of these missing women? Using a natural experiment, I link women’s intrahousehold bargaining power to their mortality risk. Using a structural household model, I estimate the age profile of women’s bargaining power and construct women’s relative poverty rates. I find that women’s bargaining power declines with age, with older women’s poverty rates closely matching their mortality rates by age. This suggests that many missing women might be accounted for by measuring poverty at the individual rather than the household level.",Rossella Calvi,,,,,,

If product market competition is tough, sellers avoid competitors by joining different platforms. This allows platforms to sustain high fees and explains why, for example, in some online markets, several homogeneous platforms segment the market. Instead, if product market competition is soft, agglomeration on a single platform emerges, and platforms fight for the dominant position. These insights give rise to novel predictions. For instance, market concentration and fees are negatively correlated in platform industries, which inverts the standard logic of competition.",Heiko Karle,Martin Peitz,Markus Reisinger,,,,

We identify and estimate a structural model of regulator-discharger interactions, exploiting an increase in the enforcement stringency of water pollution regulations in California. Our estimates indicate that most of the heterogeneity in punishments for observably similar violations is due to heterogeneity in discharger compliance costs rather than heterogeneity in regulator preferences.

We develop a model through which key features of GATS, including its emphasis on “deep integration” can be understood.

We call such acquisitions “killer acquisitions.” We develop a model illustrating this phenomenon. Using pharmaceutical industry data, we show that acquired drug projects are less likely to be developed when they overlap with the acquirer’s existing product portfolio, especially when the acquirer’s market power is large because of weak competition or distant patent expiration. Conservative estimates indicate that 5.3%–7.4% of acquisitions in our sample are killer acquisitions.

These shape restrictions, based on optimal transport theory and generalized convexity, allow us to identify preferences for goods differentiated along multiple dimensions from the observation of a single market. We thereby derive identification results for nonseparable simultaneous equations and multiattribute hedonic equilibrium models with (possibly) multiple dimensions of unobserved heterogeneity.

Sharing information reduces uncertainty about future value. With less uncertainty, risk-averse bidders bid more.
