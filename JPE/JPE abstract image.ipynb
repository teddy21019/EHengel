Unfortunately, with competition among buyers over the price paid for each level of the signal, there is, in general, no Nash equilibrium. However, it is sufficient for equilibrium that (i) low-quality sellers would, under symmetric information, choose not to enter the market, and (ii) the rate at which the marginal cost of signaling declines across types is sufficiently large.       \n",

Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations is universally regarded as a book that powerfully presented the social case for giving the businessman the maximum degree of freedom of action. And yet, although Smith unqualifiedly treats high wages as desirable, he treats high profits as undesirable. Why did so eloquent a spokesman for capitalism and laissez faire treat high profits with such unrelieved hostility? The interpretation of Smith presented in answering this question revolves primarily around the belief that easily earned high profits destroy the effectiveness with which the capitalist carries out his social role. \n",

      "A system of derived input demand functions with the property of zero elasticity of substitution between any pair of inputs is investigated. It is shown that such a system can be derived from cost minimization subject to a production function constraint. The underlying production function is explicitly derived and is named the “nonhomothetic Leontief production function,” it being the most general production function with zero elasticities of substitution between all pairs of inputs. This production function allows differential returns to scale to inputs. It is applied to a sample of Japanese petrochemical plants. The results indicate that homotheticity must be rejected; that there are substantial though different economies of scale with respect to capital and labor, but that energy and raw materials are used in constant proportions to output, even over time; that technical progress, to the extent that it is present, is embodied in scale. \n",

      "This paper analyzes the effects of changes in relative commodity prices on the distribution of income among factors of production in the context of two models of a simple, two-good economy. In the first model capital is treated as a specific factor in each industry, with labor mobile between industries. The assumption of specificity determines the direction of factor income changes, with magnitudes depending on substitutability between factors and on intensities of factor use within the two industries. In the second model, capital is viewed as a quasi-fixed factor. For the short run, this model is identical to the model first considered. For the long run, this model is identical to the Stolper-Samuelson model in which the direction and magnitude of factor income changes depend solely on relative factor intensities. The difference between the short-run and long-run determinants of changes in factor incomes gives rise to a conflict between factor owners’ short-run and long-run interests. \n",

      "This essay uses simple tools of economic theory to analyze interactions between the behavior of some persons and different characteristics of other persons, Although these interactions are emphasized in the contemporary sociological and anthropological literature, and were considered the cornerstone of behavior by several prominent nineteenth-century economists, they have been largely ignored in the modern economic literature. The central concept of the analysis is “social income,” the sum of a person’s own income (his earnings, etc.) and the monetary value to him of the relevant characteristics of others, which I call his social environment. By using the concept of social income, I can analyze the effect on these expenditures of changes in different sources of income and in different prices, including the “price” of the social environment. Interactions among members of the same family receive the greatest attention. The “head” of a family is defined not by sex or age, but as that member, if there is one, who transfers general purchasing power to all other members because he cares about their welfare. A family with a head is a highly interdependent organization that has the following properties: A redistribution of income among members does not affect the consumption or welfare of any member because it simply induces offsetting changes in transfers from the head. Not only the head but other members too act “as if” they “loved” all members, even when they are really selfish, in the sense that they maximize not their own income alone but family income. Transfers from parents to children in the form, say, of schooling, gifts, and bequests tend to be negatively related to what the income of children would be relative to their parents in the absence of these transfers. Therefore, the relative income of children inclusive of transfers could be unrelated or even negatively related to these transfers. Consequently, one cannot infer anything about the stability across generations of economic or social positions simply from knowing the relation between parental position and the amount transferred.    \n",

It then shows how the effect of technical progress on the demand for different kinds of labor may be modeled by means of shift parameters within the aggregation function, and provides estimates for them and the other parameters of the aggregation function using time series data for the United States as a whole. The results assembled in the paper indicate that, for the purpose of estimating total growth in output due to labor, a time-dependent CES function with a fine classification of labor should yield the most accurate predictions, provided that the shift parameters can be estimated. Otherwise, there is little to be gained by going beyond wage-weighted linear aggregation. For educational planners, the most obvious implication of the results is that the manpower requirements approach should be abandoned. They suggest that rate-ofreturn analysis with constant relative wage rates should be a less misleading tool for planning, at least in the short run. However, since such analysis is sensitive to changes in wage differentials, and since these in turn are sensitive to the specification of the aggregation structure, it would be much better still to use the CES function approach to obtain a feedback relationship between the growth of the different levels of the educational system and the rates of return to them, via the growth of the labor force and the structure of wages. \n",

      "The assumption that government bonds are perceived as net wealth by the private sector is crucial in demonstrating real effects of shifts in the stock of public debt. In particular, the standard effects of “expansionary” fiscal policy on aggregate demand hinge on this assumption. Government bonds will be perceived as net wealth only if their value exceeds the capitalized value of the implied stream of future tax liabilities. This paper considers the effects on bond values and tax capitalization of finite lives, imperfect private capital markets, a government monopoly in the production of bond “liquidity services,” and uncertainty about future tax obligations. It is shown within the context of an overlappinggenerations model that finite lives will not be relevant to the capitalization of future tax liabilities so long as current generations are connected to future generations by a chain of operative intergenerational transfers (either in the direction from old to young or in the direction from young to old). Applications of this result to social security and to other types of imposed intergenerational transfer schemes are also noted. In the presence of imperfect private capital markets, government debt issue will increase net wealth if the government is more efficient, at the margin, than the private market in carrying out the loan process. Similarly, if the government has monopoly power in the production of bond “liquidity services,” then public debt issue will raise net wealth. Finally, the existence of uncertainty with respect to individual future tax liabilities implies that public debt issue may increase the overall risk contained in household balance sheets and thereby effectively reduce household wealth. \n",

We test this implication, which we call the Hotelling Valuation Principle, by regressing the market values of the reserves of a sample of U.S. domestic oil- and gas-producing companies on their estimated Hotelling values. We find that the es timated Hotelling values account for a significant portion of the observed variations in market values and that the Hotelling mez sures are better indicators of the market values of petroleum properties than two widely cited publicly available alternative appraisals.              \n",

This paper evaluates this viewpoint with special reference to the present debate on income redistribution and concludes that those with liberal values indeed may have to eschew adherence to Pareto optimality, especially where the issues of market destruction and the extension of the public sector are at stake. Liberal policy recommendations are derived from a social and political philosophy far more comprehensive than that which underpins discussions of economic efficiency derived from the Pareto principle. \n",

The analysis reveals that the feasible range of regulation is restricted by the same forces that block private agreement. The focus of the study is oil field unitization regulation in Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming (federal lands) from 1948 through 1975. Despite large potential gains from unitization, private negotiations fail because of lease heterogeneities and information problems regarding lease value estimates. In response, the federal and state governments have adopted strikingly different policies to encourage unitization with different results. Only the federal government’s regulations are effective because they surmount information problems. Texas has the least successful regulation.

First, I derive the crucial formulas for the excess burden of anticipated and unanticipated, temporary and permanent, tax changes. Second, I derive closed-form expressions for the excess burdens when tax rates are low. Third, using a range of estimates for taste and technology parameters suggested by the empirical literature, I compute various examples and find that excess burdens are larger than indicated by previous studies that use alternative models, very sensitive to parameter estimates, and equally sensitive to anticipation effects. However, the rankings of alternative tax policies turn out to be insensitive to these estimates. Both the analytical computations and the computed examples indicate that delay increases the cost of capital income taxation but tends to reduce the efficiency cost of wage taxation. Furthermore, immediate and temporary investment tax credits are always self-financing, and an investment tax credit at a future time dominates a capital income tax cut at that time. Generally, the timing and anticipated duration of any tax policy are as important as the technical and taste parameters in determining its efficacy.                \n",

The self-interest hypothesis of regulation and fisherman heterogeneity can explain two historically popular types of fishery regulations, season closures and capital constraints. These have differential impacts on fishermen and typically redistribute the fishery’s harvest from more efficient toward less efficient producers. To the extent that fishermen indigenous to a regulatory body's jurisdiction also tend to be relatively inefficient, it is predicted that these regulations will withstand the theory and data that demonstrate their suboptimality.       \n",

      "Search theory, which purports to explain how individuals behave when they have imperfect or incomplete market information, has received much attention recently. Economists have derived a number of results characterizing the effects of various changes on optimal-search behavior. Almost without exception, these results depend on the untenable assumption that searchers know the probability distribution from which they are searching. This paper studies the effect of assuming instead that searchers learn about the probability distribution while they search from it. Not invariably, but in many instances, the qualitative properties of optimal-search strategies—and thus the behavior of those who follow them—are the same as in the simpler case when the distribution is assumed known. \n",

      "‘The article examines the behavior of the ratio of gross private saving to gross national product—the gross private savings rate or GPSR— for the United States during the period 1898-1969. It emerges that the GPSR defined to include consumer durables expenditures and the imputed return on durables has no trend over the period and that its year-to-year variation is extremely small except for the World War I, World War II, and Great Depression years. This stability prevailed in the face of pronounced shifts in the composition of private savings from personal saving to durables expenditure and corporate saving, and a redistribution of income from the private to public sectors. The notion of ultrarationality, in which households subsume corporate and government spending and saving in their budget decisions, is used to explain the stability of the GPSR despite the important changes in its composition. Leading implications of this stability for theory and policy are explored: one important conclusion is that, under full employment, fiscal policy  can neither affect aggregate expenditure nor alter the ratio of investment to consumption. \n",

This paper relaxes that assumption by specifying a multiperiod-consumption function which introduces age-distribution parameters explicitly into the model. This is accomplished by specifying a multiperiod constant-elasticity-of-substitution (CES) type utility function where the consumer’s time horizon is determined by various age-distribution parameters such as median age, retirement age, etc. The proportion of lifetime income spent on current consumption is shown to depend on the rate of interest, the age-distribution parameters, and the parameters of the utility function. Lifetime income, in turn, depends on the interest rates and age parameters. The model, which is nonlinear, is estimated using annual data from 1948 to 1965. The effects of changes in interest rates and age parameters are assessed, and a prediction-interval test is applied to the model. \n",

These conditions are tested using proprietary data from a mining firm. Output price data and coefficient estimates from a translog cost system are used to compute the in situ value of the resource and the stock effect. Changes in the in situ value over time are then statistically compared with the expected price path. The results reject the hypothesis that the data are consistent with the theoretical model and the maintained hypotheses. Variations of the basic model that incorporate a time-varying discount rate, an alternative expected price series, and a constraint on the rate of outputare also tested and rejected.                \n",

Efficiency is shown to depend on the price elasticity of private spending and the trade-off between public and private spending.

Looking at distributional effects, 1 show when richer taxpayers may prefer a tax credit to deductibility, even though they face lower prices with deductibility.

      "The underlying thesis of this paper is that static measures of concentration cannot by themselves indicate the degree of monopoly power in an industry or market. The argument behind this view is that the monopoly power of the large firms ultimately depends on their ability to inhibit entry and the growth of smaller firms. No static measure of concentration can reflect this ability because it can only be measured over a period of time. The main part of the paper is concerned with developing and interpreting new measures that would incorporate within them the power, or lack of power, of the large firms to inhibit entry and the growth of smaller firms. In developing these measures, the starting point is the work of Friedman and Kuznets in measuring the permanent component of an income distribution. The market shares of the firms are divided into permanent and transitory components, and the paper shows that by comparison of observed market shares for two different periods of time it is possible to infer measures of concentration that are based upon the permanent component of the shares. These measures of permanent concentration incorporate within them the ability of the large firms to inhibit entry and the growth of smaller firms.       \n",

The profit rates used in these studies are based on treating advertising expenditures as a current expense. Much evidence exists that advertising has a long-lasting effect on sales, so that the treatment of advertising as a current expense is inappropriate. In this paper, corrected profit rates are calculated by treating advertising expenditures as an investment in a capital asset. The corrected profit rates are then used in a multivariate regression analysis of the relationship between profitability, market structure, and advertising intensity. No significant relationship between corrected profit rates and advertising intensity is found in the regressions.

It is assumed that individuals inherit an initial stock of health that depreciates with age and can be increased by investment. In this framework, the “shadow price” of health depends on many other variables besides the price of medical care. It is shown that the shadow price rises with age if the rate of depreciation on the stock of health rises over the life cycle and falls with education if more educated people are more efficient producers of health. Of particular importance is the conclusion that, under certain conditions, an increase in the shadow price may simultaneously reduce the quantity of health demanded and increase the quantity of medical care demanded. \n",

A comparison of the Kuhn-Tucker conditions which arises in the various cases indicates that the method of regulation can have a substantial effect on the distribution of price reductions between peak and off-peak users. Under regulation limiting rate of return on capital investment, the price reductions are received entirely by peak-period users. In contrast, when regulation limits profit per unit or return on cost, there are price reductions for all users. \n",

      "In this paper a general equilibrium business cycle model is constructed that, when subjected to real disturbances, mimics observed qualitative comovements among real output, money, business failures, risk premia, intermediary loans, and prices. In contrast, monetary disturbances generate cycles that have several inconsistencies with empirical evidence, thus providing support for real business cycle theory at the expense of monetary theories of the business cycle. Financial intermediation arises endogenously in the model and intermediation matters for business cycle behavior. A credit supply mechanism acts in tandem with an intertemporal substitution effect in propagating stochastic disturbances.                     \n",

Observed product prices and the specific amounts of characteristics associated with each good define a set of implicit or “hedonic” prices. A theory of hedonic prices is formulated as a problem in the economics of spatial equilibrium in which the entire set of implicit prices guides both consumer and producer locational decisions in characteristics space. Buyer and seller choices, as well as the meaning and nature of market equilibrium, are analyzed. Empirical implications for hedonic price regressions and index number construction are pointed out. \n",

      "This paper derives the cost-of-living index of an individual who faces imperfect and costly information about prices. Traditional cost-of-living indices assume that the consumer passively accepts prices as given. We begin by deriving a multiprice search model in which the consumer chooses the search strategy that minimizes the expected cost of buying a given level of utility. In contrast to existing search models, our search model allows the consumer to change the allocation of expenditures among goods as information about prices changes and enables us to construct a cost-of-living index for an agent who searches across distributions of offer prices. Unlike traditional cost-of-living measures that ignore search behavior, the searcher's cost-of-living index depends on search costs. This index is compared with those of consumers who shop randomly and also those who enjoy perfect information, and some bounding results are presented.                  \n",

Among the results are (a) international prices should be used for evaluating public projects, unless there is a government budgetary constraint or there is a quota (this result does not require that tariff rates be optimally chosen); (6) no tariff should be levied on intermediates and only consumption taxes should be employed if there are 100 percent profit taxes.

A discontinuous mid-life increase in health investment (retirement) is shown, in general, to be part of the optimal investment strategy.

The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to enumerate a few of the more fundamental conceptual differences between the monetary analysis of Keynes and that of Friedman. Keynes’s analysis involves (1) the concept of uncertainty in the Knight-Keynes sense, (2) the inapplicability of a Walrasian system to a real world production economy where false trades occur, and (3) the essential properties of money which follow from the existence of uncertainty. This paper shows that recognition of these conceptual differences leads to significantly different specification of the demand for money and its supply aspects in the Keynesian system compared with Friedman’s theoretical framework. \n",

      "The article is based on textual evidence from the quantity-theory and Keynesian literature. It shows, first, that the conceptual framework of a portfolio demand for money that Friedman denotes as the “quantity theory” is actually that of Keynesian economics. Conversely, Friedman detracts from the true quantity theory by stating that its formal short-run analysis assumes real output constant, while only prices change, Friedman also incorrectly characterizes Keynesian economics in terms of absolute price rigidity. He does this by overlooking the systematic analysis by Keynes and the Keynesians of the role of downward wage flexibility during unemployment, and of the “inflationary gap” during full employment. Otherwise Friedman’s interpretation of Keynes is the standard textbook one of an economy in a “liquiditytrap” unemployment equilibrium. The author restates his alternative interpretation of Keynesian economics in terms of unemployment disequilibrium. \n",

For example, government support or exogenous surges in demand could increase both at the same time. Although the first two of these relations involve influences of one variable on another over time, the problem of distinguishing between a simultaneous and a recursive relation has not been tackled in previous work. The current study employs distributed lag techniques with pooled time-series and cross-section data to discriminate among the alternative types of time relations. A sample of seven industries containing 111 firms covering the 1950-65 period was used to test these relations.

To avoid this assumption, Friedman’s second “monetary theory of nominal income” takes interest rates as exogenous in the short run; but the model has strange inconsistencies and implications.

Underlying this argument, however, is the assumption that preference maps of consumers are known. In this paper, this assumption is relaxed. It is shown that a system of atomistic competition will lead to suboptimal levels of public goods, and that those public goods which are produced will be inefficiently allocated. Furthermore, owing to different intensities of use, units of public goods will command different prices.

      "This paper applies previous theoretical and empirical results on inflation and demand for money to a study of inflationary finance and the welfare cost of inflation. The amount of revenue generated by a steady inflation is derived as a function of the inflation rate and some underlying parameters. Empirically, the revenue-maximizing rate is on the order of 140 percent per month with the corresponding revenue approximating 15 percent of national income. It is argued that hyperinflations become unstable when the revenue-maximizing rate is exceeded. Because inflation leads to higher transaction costs (resulting from greater payment frequencies and reduced use of “money” as a payments medium), there is a net social cost attached to inflationary finance. The model implies that marginal collection costs of inflationary finance exceed 50 percent for all positive rates of inflation—hence, alternative means of raising revenue should be socially preferable. The analysis also provides estimates of the social gain from moving to the optimum quantity of money as 1-3 percent of income. \n",

As a result, although the tax system is less progressive than the rate structure alone makes it appear, it is more progressive than it would appear if we look only at net economic incomes and taxes.
