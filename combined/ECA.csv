However, we argue that regional business cycles contain valuable information that can help discipline models of aggregate fluctuations. We begin by documenting a strong relationship across U.S. states between local employment and wage growth during the Great Recession. This relationship is much weaker in U.S. aggregates. Then, we present a methodology that combines such regional and aggregate data in order to estimate a medium-scale New Keynesian DSGE model. We find that aggregate demand shocks were important drivers of aggregate employment during the Great Recession, but the wage stickiness necessary for them to account for the slow employment recovery and the modest fall in aggregate wages is inconsistent with the flexibility of wages we observe across U.S. states. Finally, we show that our methodology yields different conclusions about the causes of aggregate employment and wage dynamics between 2007 and 2014 than either estimating our model with aggregate data alone or performing back-of-the-envelope calculations that directly extrapolate from well-identified regional elasticities.","Martin Beraja, Erik Hurst and Juan Ospina",Martin Beraja,Erik Hurst,Juan Ospina,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Under such conditions, delay may arise when bargainers face direct forms of strategic uncertainty—that is, uncertainty about the opponent's play. The paper restricts the nature of this uncertainty in two important ways. First, it assumes on-path strategic certainty: Bargainers face uncertainty only after surprise moves. Second, it assumes Battigalli and Siniscalchi's (2002) rationality and common strong belief of rationality (RCSBR)—a requirement that bargainers are ""strategically sophisticated."" The main result characterizes the set of outcomes consistent with on-path strategic certainty and RCSBR. It shows that these assumptions allow for delayed agreement, despite the fact that the bargaining environment is one of complete information. The source of delay is second-order optimism: Bargainers do not put forward ""good"" offers early in the negotiation process because they fear that doing so will cause the other party to become more optimistic about her future prospects.",Amanda Friedenberg,Amanda Friedenberg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The sender's payoff depends on the belief he induces, via an exogenously given monotone function. We show that by using a randomized verification strategy, the receiver can learn the sender's information fully in many cases. We characterize exactly when it is possible to do so. In particular, when the exogenous payoff function is submodular, we can explicitly describe a full-learning mechanism; when it is (strictly) supermodular, full learning is not possible. In leading cases where full learning is possible, it can be attained using an indirect mechanism in which the sender chooses the probability of verifying each dimension.",Gabriel Carroll and Georgy Egorov,Gabriel Carroll,Georgy Egorov,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

That is, the agent has a quantite utility preference instead of the standard expected utility. Quantile preferences have useful advantages, including the ability to capture heterogeneity and allowing the separation between risk aversion and elasticity of intertemporal substitution. Although quantiles do not share some of the helpful properties of expectations, such as linearity and the law of iterated expectations, we are able to establish all the standard results in dynamic models. Namely, we show that the quantile preferences are dynamically consistent, the corresponding dynamic problem yields a value function, via a fixed point argument, this value function is concave and differentiable, and the principle of optimality holds. Additionally, we derive the corresponding Euler equation, which is well suited for using well-known quantile regression methods for estimating and testing the economic model. In this way, the parameters of the model can be interpreted as structural objects. Therefore, the proposed methods provide microeconomic foundations for quantile regression methods. To illustrate the developments, we construct an intertemporal consumption model and estimate the discount factor and elasticity of intertemporal substitution parameters across the quantiles. The results provide evidence of heterogeneity in these parameters.",Luciano de Castro and Antonio F. Galvao,Luciano de Castro,Antonio F. Galvao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We show first that even when (Ut) is arbitrary, dynamic random utility imposes new testable across-period restrictions on behavior, over and above period-by-period analogs of the static random utility axioms. An important feature of dynamic random utility is that behavior may appear history-dependent, because period-t choices reveal information about Ut, which may be serially correlated; however, our key new axioms highlight that the model entails specific limits on the form of history dependence that can arise. Second, we show that imposing natural Bayesian rationality axioms restricts the form of randomness that (Ut) can display. By contrast, a specification of utility shocks that is widely used in empirical work violates these restrictions, leading to behavior that may display a negative option value and can produce biased parameter estimates. Finally, dynamic stochastic choice data allow us to characterize important special cases of random utility—in particular, learning and taste persistence—that on static domains are indistinguishable from the general model.","Mira Frick, Ryota Iijima and Tomasz Strzalecki",Mira Frick,Ryota Iijima,Tomasz Strzalecki,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We define a mechanism to be strategically simple if choices can be based on first-order beliefs about the other agents' preferences and first-order certainty about the other agents' rationality alone, and there is no need for agents to form higher-order beliefs, because such beliefs are irrelevant to the optimal strategies. All dominant strategy mechanisms are strategically simple. But many more mechanisms are strategically simple.

Any combination of weights and threshold can be optimal. A standard quorum rule can be optimal only when it yields the same outcome as a linear rule. A linear rule is called upper linear if the default is upset at every election result that meets the threshold exactly. We develop a perturbation method to characterize equilibria of voting rules in the case of small participation costs and show that leaving participation voluntary increases welfare for any two-sided upper linear rule that is optimal under compulsory participation.",Hans Peter Grüner and Thomas Tröger,Hans Peter Grüner,Thomas Tröger,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Unlike the existing work, my model allows for rich investor heterogeneity in three simultaneous dimensions: preferences, inventories, and meeting rates. By comparing trading-volume patterns that arise in my model and are observed in practice, I argue that the heterogeneity in meeting rates is the main driver of intermediation patterns. I find that investors with higher meeting rates (i.e., fast investors) are less averse to holding inventories and more attracted to cash earnings, which makes the model corroborate a number of stylized facts that do not emerge from existing models: (i) fast investors provide intermediation by charging a speed premium, and (ii) fast investors hold more extreme inventories. Then, I use the model to study the effect of trading frictions on the supply and price of liquidity. On social welfare, I show that the interaction of meeting rate heterogeneity with optimal inventory management makes the equilibrium inefficient. I provide a financial transaction tax/subsidy scheme that corrects this inefficiency, in which fast investors cross-subsidize slow investors.",Semi̇h Üslü,Semi̇h Üslü,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We examine the effect on aggregate productivity of the convergence in the occupational distribution between 1960 and 2010 through the prism of a Roy model. Across our various specifications, between 20% and 40% of growth in aggregate market output per person can be explained by the improved allocation of talent.","Chang-Tai Hsieh, Erik Hurst, Charles I.

Using data from the U.S. Longitudinal Business Database on all nonfarm private businesses from 1983 to 2013, we arrive at three main conclusions: First, most growth appears to come from incumbents. We infer this from the modest employment share of entering firms (defined as those less than 5 years old). Second, most growth seems to occur through improvements of existing varieties rather than creation of brand new varieties. Third, own-product improvements by incumbents appear to be more important than creative destruction. We infer this because the distribution of job creation and destruction has thinner tails than implied by a model with a dominant role for creative destruction.","Daniel Garcia-Macia, Chang-Tai Hsieh and Peter J.

No political messages or nonfinancial information were included. The treatment systematically shifted vote choices toward parties more supportive of the peace process. This effect is not due to a direct material incentive to vote a particular way. Rather, the treatment reduces opposition to concessions for peace and changes awareness of the broader economic risks of conflict. While participants who were assigned Palestinian assets are more likely to associate their assets' performance with peace, they are less engaged in the experiment.

We first show that the existence of differential constraints has an impact on prices and allocations as compared to a complete financial market with unconstrained agents. We consider the implications for survival, taking the work of Blume and Easley (2006) as a starting point. We show that whenever agents have identical correct beliefs and equal discount factors, and their partitions are nested, all agents survive. When agents have heterogeneous beliefs, differential constraints may allow agents with wrong beliefs to survive. Provided constraints are relevant (in a sense we define more precisely), the condition for an agent to survive is that his survival index is at least as large as that of the agents with finer partitions. We also study the impact of deregulation (an increase in the set of assets available to some agents). Unless the agent can adopt beliefs that are closer to the truth on the newly refined partition than those of less constrained agents, increasing his opportunities for trade might harm his chances for survival.",Ani Guerdjikova and John Quiggin,Ani Guerdjikova,John Quiggin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We also show how microeconomic parameters are mapped to these reduced-form general equilibrium elasticities. In this sense, we extend the foundational theorem of Hulten (1978) beyond the first order to capture nonlinearities. Key features ignored by first-order approximations that play a crucial role are: structural microeconomic elasticities of substitution, network linkages, structural microeconomic returns to scale, and the extent of factor reallocation. In a business-cycle calibration with sectoral shocks, nonlinearities magnify negative shocks and attenuate positive shocks, resulting in an aggregate output distribution that is asymmetric (negative skewness), fattailed (excess kurtosis), and has a negative mean, even when shocks are symmetric and thin-tailed. Average output losses due to short-run sectoral shocks are an order of magnitude larger than the welfare cost of business cycles calculated by Lucas (1987). Nonlinearities can also cause shocks to critical sectors to have disproportionate macroeconomic effects, almost tripling the estimated impact of the 1970s oil shocks on world aggregate output. Finally, in a long-run growth context, nonlinearities, which underpin Baumol's cost disease via the increase over time in the sales shares of low-growth bottleneck sectors, account for a 20 percentage point reduction in aggregate TFP growth over the period 1948-2014 in the United States.",David Rezza Baqaee and Emmanuel Farhi,David Rezza Baqaee,Emmanuel Farhi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The extreme points of the calibrated projection confidence interval are obtained by extremizing the value of the function of interest subject to a proper relaxation of studentized sample analogs of the moment (in)equality conditions. The degree of relaxation, or critical level, is calibrated so that the function of θ, not θ itself, is uniformly asymptotically covered with prespecified probability. This calibration is based on repeatedly checking feasibility of linear programming problems, rendering it computationally attractive. Nonetheless, the program defining an extreme point of the confidence interval is generally nonlinear and potentially intricate. We provide an algorithm, based on the response surface method for global optimization, that approximates the solution rapidly and accurately, and we establish its rate of convergence. The algorithm is of independent interest for optimization problems with simple objectives and complicated constraints. An empirical application estimating an entry game illustrates the usefulness of the method. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the accuracy of the solution algorithm, the good statistical as well as computational performance of calibrated projection (including in comparison to other methods), and the algorithm's potential to greatly accelerate computation of other confidence intervals.","Hiroaki Kaido, Francesca Molinari and Jörg Stoye",Hiroaki Kaido,Francesca Molinari,Jörg Stoye,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We introduce two models: a static model that allows for nonlinear interactions between workers and firms, and a dynamic model that allows, in addition, for Markovian earnings dynamics and endogenous mobility. We show that this framework nests a number of structural models of wages and worker mobility. We establish identification in short panels, and develop tractable two-step estimators where firms are classified in a first step. Applying our method to Swedish administrative data, we find that log-earnings are approximately additive in worker and firm heterogeneity. Our estimates imply the presence of strong sorting patterns between workers and firms, and a small contribution of firms—net of worker composition—to earnings dispersion. In addition, we document that wages have a direct effect on mobility, and that, beyond their dependence on the current firm, earnings after a job move also depend on the previous employer.","Stéphane Bonhomme, Thibaut Lamadon and Elena Manresa",Stéphane Bonhomme,Thibaut Lamadon,Elena Manresa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The model captures the role of labor mobility frictions, goods mobility frictions, geographic factors, and input-output linkages in determining equilibrium allocations. We show how to solve the equilibrium of the model and take the model to the data without assuming that the economy is at a steady state and without estimating productivities, migration frictions, or trade costs, which can be difficult to identify. We calibrate the model to 22 sectors, 38 countries, and 50 U.S. states. We study how the rise in China's trade for the period 2000 to 2007 impacted U.S. households across more than a thousand U.S. labor markets distinguished by sector and state. We find that the China trade shock resulted in a reduction of about 0.55 million U.S. manufacturing jobs, about 16% of the observed decline in manufacturing employment from 2000 to 2007. The U.S. gains in the aggregate, but due to trade and migration frictions, the welfare and employment effects vary across U.S. labor markets. Estimated transition costs to the new long-run equilibrium are also heterogeneous and reflect the importance of accounting for labor dynamics.","Lorenzo Caliendo, Maximiliano Dvorkin and Fernando Parro",Lorenzo Caliendo,Maximiliano Dvorkin,Fernando Parro,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We refer to this representation notion as the coalitional minmax expected utility representation. By adding the remaining properties of the expected utility theorem, namely, continuity, completeness, and transitivity, one by one, we find how this representation gets sharper and sharper, thereby deducing the versions of this classical theorem in which any combination of these properties is dropped from its statement. This approach also allows us to weaken transitivity in this theorem, rather than eliminate it entirely, say, to quasitransitivity or acyclicity. Apart from providing a unified dissection of the expected utility theorem, these results are relevant for the growing literature on boundedly rational choice in which revealed preference relations often lack the properties of completeness and/or transitivity (but often satisfy the independence axiom). They are also especially suitable for the (yet overlooked) case in which the decision-maker is made up of distinct individuals and, consequently, transitivity is routinely violated. Finally, and perhaps more importantly, we show that our representation theorems allow us to answer many economic questions that are posed in terms of nontransitive/incomplete preferences, say, about the maximization of preferences, the existence of Nash equilibrium, the preference for portfolio diversification, and the possibility of the preference reversal phenomenon.","Kazuhiro Hara, Efe A.

Surprisingly, only about 10% of individuals over age 62 have private long-term care insurance (LTCI) and LTCI takeup rates are low at all wealth levels. We analyze the contributions of Medicaid, administrative costs, and asymmetric information about nursing home entry risk to low LTCI takeup rates in a quantitative equilibrium contracting model. As in practice, the insurer in the model assigns individuals to risk groups based on noisy indicators of their nursing home entry risk. All individuals in frail and/or low-income risk groups are denied coverage because the cost of insuring any individual in these groups exceeds that individual's willingness-to-pay. Individuals in insurable risk groups are offered a menu of contracts whose terms vary across risk groups. We find that Medicaid accounts for low LTCI takeup rates of poorer individuals. However, administrative costs and adverse selection are responsible for low takeup rates of the rich. The model reproduces other empirical features of the LTCI market including the fact that owners of LTCI have about the same nursing home entry rates as non-owners.","R. Anton Braun, Karen A.

We study under which conditions this method can be applied and show the following: In asymptotic regimes where the dimensionality of the parameter space is fixed as sample size increases, there often exist tests that cannot be further improved with the power enhancement principle. However, when the dimensionality of the parameter space increases sufficiently slowly with sample size and a marginal local asymptotic normality (LAN) condition is satisfied, every test with asymptotic size smaller than 1 can be improved with the power enhancement principle. While the marginal LAN condition alone does not allow one to extend the latter statement to all rates at which the dimensionality increases with sample size, we give sufficient conditions under which this is the case.",Anders Bredahl Kock and David Preinerstorfer,Anders Bredahl Kock,David Preinerstorfer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We test a necessary and sufficient condition for this that does not restrict unobserved heterogeneity or the number of goods. We also propose and implement a control function approach to account for endogenous expenditure. An econometric result of independent interest is a test for linear inequality constraints when these are represented as the vertices of a polyhedral cone rather than its faces.

Despite the apparent importance of heterogeneity, a common practice in modern empirical work is to largely ignore it by reporting average partial effects (or, at best, average effects for some groups). While average effects provide very convenient scalar summaries of typical effects, by definition they fail to reflect the entire variety of the heterogeneous effects. In order to discover these effects much more fully, we propose to estimate and report sorted effects—a collection of estimated partial effects sorted in increasing order and indexed by percentiles. By construction, the sorted effect curves completely represent and help visualize the range of the heterogeneous effects in one plot. They are as convenient and easy to report in practice as the conventional average partial effects. They also serve as a basis for classification analysis, where we divide the observational units into most or least affected groups and summarize their characteristics. We provide a quantification of uncertainty (standard errors and confidence bands) for the estimated sorted effects and related classification analysis, and provide confidence sets for the most and least affected groups. The derived statistical results rely on establishing key, new mathematical results on Hadamard differentiability of a multivariate sorting operator and a related classification operator, which are of independent interest. We apply the sorted effects method and classification analysis to demonstrate several striking patterns in the gender wage gap. We find that this gap is particularly strong for married women, ranging from -60% to 0% between the 2% and 98% percentiles, as a function of observed and unobserved characteristics; while the gap for never married women ranges from -40% to +20%. The most adversely affected women tend to be married, do not have college degrees, work in sales, and have high levels of potential experience.","Victor Chernozhukov, Iván Fernández-Val and Ye Luo",Victor Chernozhukov,Iván Fernández-Val,Ye Luo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We provide computationally attractive procedures to construct confidence sets (CSs) for identified sets of the full parameter vector and of subvectors in models defined through a likelihood or a vector of moment equalities or inequalities. The CSs are based on level sets of ""optimal"" criterion functions (such as likelihoods, optimally-weighted or continuously-updated GMM criterions). The level sets are constructed using cutoffs that are computed via Monte Carlo (MC) simulations from the quasi-posterior distribution of the criterion. We establish new Bernstein-von Mises (or Bayesian Wilks) type theorems for the quasi-posterior distributions of the quasi-likelihood ratio (QLR) and profile QLR in partially-identified models. These results imply that our MC CSs have exact asymptotic frequentist coverage for identified sets of full parameters and of subvectors in partially-identified regular models, and have valid but potentially conservative coverage in models whose local tangent spaces are convex cones. Further, our MC CSs for identified sets of subvectors are shown to have exact asymptotic coverage in models with singularities. We provide local power properties and uniform validity of our CSs over classes of DGPs that include pointand partially-identified models.

We consider both intertemporal and intratemporal choices, and identify intensive and extensive responses in a consistent life-cycle framework, using US CEX data. Heterogeneity is due to observables, such as age, wealth, hours worked, and the wage level, as well as to unobservable tastes for leisure: the median Marshallian elasticity for hours worked is 0.18, with corresponding Hicksian elasticity of 0.54 and Frisch elasticity of 0.87. At the 90th percentile, these values are 0.79, 1.16, and 1.92. Responses at the extensive margin explain about 54% of the total labor supply response for women under 30, although this declines with age. Aggregate elasticities are higher in recessions, and increase with the length of the recession. The heterogeneity at the micro level means that the aggregate labor supply elasticity is not a structural parameter: any aggregate elasticity will depend on the demographic structure of the economy as well as the distribution of wealth and the particular point in the business cycle.","Orazio Attanasio, Peter Levell, Hamish Low and Virginia Sánchez-Marcos",Orazio Attanasio,Peter Levell,Hamish Low,Virginia Sánchez-Marcos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We use a field experiment and a structural model to study how plant emission standards are enforced. In collaboration with an Indian environmental regulator, we experimentally doubled the rate of inspection for treatment plants and required that the extra inspections be assigned randomly. We find that treatment plants only slightly increased compliance. We hypothesize that this weak effect is due to poor targeting, since the random inspections in the treatment found fewer extreme violators than the regulator's own discretionary inspections. To unbundle the roles of extra inspections and the removal of discretion over what plants to target, we set out a model of environmental regulation where the regulator targets inspections, based on a signal of pollution, to maximize plant abatement. Using the experiment to identify key parameters of the model, we find that the regulator aggressively targets its discretionary inspections, to the degree that half of the plants receive fewer than one inspection per year, while plants expected to be the dirtiest may receive ten. Counterfactual simulations show that discretion in targeting helps enforcement: inspections that the regulator assigns cause three times more abatement than would the same number of randomly assigned inspections. Nonetheless, we find that the regulator's information on plant pollution is poor, and improvements in monitoring would reduce emissions.","Esther Duflo, Michael Greenstone, Rohini Pande and Nicholas Ryan",Esther Duflo,Michael Greenstone,Rohini Pande,Nicholas Ryan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We focus on long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) and the large (approximately $13,500) jump in Medicare payments they receive when a patient's stay reaches a threshold number of days. Discharges increase substantially after the threshold, with the marginal discharged patient in relatively better health. Despite the large financial incentives and behavioral response in a high mortality population, we are unable to detect any compelling evidence of an impact on patient mortality. To assess provider behavior under counterfactual payment schedules, we estimate a simple dynamic discrete choice model of LTCH discharge decisions. When we conservatively limit ourselves to alternative contracts that hold the LTCH harmless, we find that an alternative contract can generate Medicare savings of about $2,100 per admission, or about 5% of total payments. More aggressive payment reforms can generate substantially greater savings, but the accompanying reduction in LTCH profits has potential out-of-sample consequences. Our results highlight how improved financial incentives may be able to reduce healthcare spending, without negative consequences for industry profits or patient health.","Liran Einav, Amy Finkelstein and Neale Mahoney",Liran Einav,Amy Finkelstein,Neale Mahoney,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

This networking picture yields a type of aggregation that is not merely additive, resulting in a collective behavior that is richer than that of individual subsystems.

Our method exploits the insight that both the IV estimand and many treatment parameters can be expressed as weighted averages of the same underlying marginal treatment effects. Since the weights are identified, knowledge of the IV estimand generally places some restrictions on the unknown marginal treatment effects, and hence on the values of the treatment parameters of interest. We show how to extract information about the treatment parameter of interest from the IV estimand and, more generally, from a class of IV-like estimands that includes the two stage least squares and ordinary least squares estimands, among others. Our method has several applications. First, it can be used to construct nonparametric bounds on the average causal effect of a hypothetical policy change. Second, our method allows the researcher to flexibly incorporate shape restrictions and parametric assumptions, thereby enabling extrapolation of the average effects for compilers to the average effects for different or larger populations. Third, our method can be used to test model specification and hypotheses about behavior, such as no selection bias and/or no selection on gain.","Magne Mogstad, Andres Santos and Alexander Torgovitsky",Magne Mogstad,Andres Santos,Alexander Torgovitsky,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Additional evidence suggests that these results are driven by voters who value voting expressively over voting strategically for the top-two candidate they dislike the least to ensure her victory; and by third candidates who, absent party-level agreements leading to their dropping out, value the benefits associated with competing in the second round more than influencing its outcome.",Vincent Pons and Clémence Tricaud,Vincent Pons,Clémence Tricaud,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Moving beyond existing results in the literature, we show that the agent's beliefs regarding the fundamental converge under weak conditions. Furthermore, we identify a broad class of situations in which ""learning"" about the fundamental is self-defeating: it leads the individual systematically away from the correct belief and toward lower performance. Due to his overconfidence, the agent—even if initially correct—becomes too pessimistic about the fundamental. As he adjusts his behavior in response, he lowers outcomes and hence becomes even more pessimistic about the fundamental, perpetuating the misdirected learning. The greater is the loss from choosing a suboptimal action, the further the agent's action ends up from optimal. We partially characterize environments in which self-defeating learning occurs, and show that the decisionmaker learns to take the optimal action if, and in a sense only if, a specific non -identifiability condition is satisfied. In contrast to an overconfident agent, an underconfident agent's misdirected learning is self-limiting and therefore not very harmful.

The main axiom of our analysis is called mixture aversion, as it captures a dislike of probabilistic mixtures of lotteries. Our representation for mixture-averse preferences can be interpreted as if an individual optimally selects her risk attitude from some feasible set. We describe some useful parametric examples of our representation and provide comparative statics that tightly link decreases in risk aversion to larger sets of feasible risk attitudes. We then present several applications of the model. In an insurance problem, mixture-averse preferences can produce a marginal willingness to pay for insurance coverage that increases in the level of existing coverage. In investment decisions, our model can generate endogenous heterogeneity in equilibrium stock market participation, even when consumers have identical preferences.

We augment this assumption with various restrictions on how agents process the information provided by their neighbors and obtain representation theorems for the corresponding learning rules (including the canonical model of DeGroot). We then obtain general long-run learning results that are not tied to the learning rules' specific functional forms, thus identifying the fundamental forces that lead to learning, non-learning, and mislearning in social networks. Our results illustrate that, in the presence of imperfect recall, long-run aggregation of information is closely linked to (i) the rate at which agents discount their neighbors' information over time, (ii) the curvature of agents' social learning rules, and (iii) whether their initial tendencies are amplified or moderated as a result of social interactions.","Pooya Molavi, Alireza Tahbaz-Salehi and Ali Jadbabaie",Pooya Molavi,Alireza Tahbaz-Salehi,Ali Jadbabaie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Consequently, the investor has a first-order willingness to pay a portfolio manager who rebalances actively on his behalf.

We study the properties and implementation of the Empirical Welfare Maximization (EWM) method, which estimates a treatment assignment policy by maximizing the sample analog of average social welfare over a class of candidate treatment policies. The EWM approach is attractive in terms of both statistical performance and practical implementation in realistic settings of policy design. Common features of these settings include: (i) feasible treatment assignment rules are constrained exogenously for ethical, legislative, or political reasons, (ii) a policy maker wants a simple treatment assignment rule based on one or more eligibility scores in order to reduce the dimensionality of individual observable characteristics, and/or (iii) the proportion of individuals who can receive the treatment is a priori limited due to a budget or a capacity constraint. We show that when the propensity score is known, the average social welfare attained by EWM rules converges at least at n-½ rate to the maximum obtainable welfare uniformly over a minimally constrained class of data distributions, and this uniform convergence rate is minimax optimal. We examine how the uniform convergence rate depends on the richness of the class of candidate decision rules, the distribution of conditional treatment effects, and the lack of knowledge of the propensity score.

First, we estimate univariate and multivariate models of cashflow (consumption, output, dividends) growth that feature measurement errors, timevarying volatilities, and mixed-frequency observations. Monthly consumption data are important for identifying the stochastic volatility process; yet the data are contaminated, which makes the inclusion of measurement errors essential for identifying the predictable component. Second, we develop a novel state-space model for cash flows and asset prices that imposes the pricing restrictions of a representative-agent endowment economy with recursive preferences. To estimate this model, we use a particle MCMC approach that exploits the conditional linear structure of the approximate equilibrium. Once asset return data are included in the estimation, we find even stronger evidence for the persistent component and are able to identify three volatility processes: the one for the predictable cash-flow component is crucial for asset pricing, whereas the other two are important for tracking the data. Our model generates asset prices that are largely consistent with the data in terms of sample moments and predictability features. The state-space approach allows us to track over time the evolution of the predictable component, the volatility processes, the decomposition of the equity premium into risk factors, and the variance decomposition of asset prices.","Frank Schorfheide, Dongho Song and Amir Yaron",Frank Schorfheide,Dongho Song,Amir Yaron,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We derive finite-sample optimal CIs and sharp efficiency bounds under normal errors with known variance. We show that these results translate to uniform (over the function class) asymptotic results when the error distribution is not known. When the function class is centrosymmetric, these efficiency bounds imply that minimax CIs are close to efficient at smooth regression functions.

We provide a condition for sorting that captures this tradeoff between the quantity and quality of workers and that generalizes Becker's sorting condition. A system of differential equations determines the equilibrium allocation, the firm size, and wages, and allows us to characterize the allocation of the quality and quantity of labor to firms of different productivity.

In dynamic contracting and policy settings, the method often replaces an endogenous state space of forward-looking utilities with an exogenously given state space of costates. We provide a principle of optimality for dual problems and give conditions under which the dual Bellman operator is a contraction with the optimal dual value function its unique fixed point.

We develop and estimate a model of fund manager choice where sales force can increase or decrease customer price sensitivity. We find exposure to sales force lowered price sensitivity, leading to inelastic demand and high equilibrium fees.

We show that the competitive division of a mixed manna is still welfarist. If the zero utility profile is Pareto dominated, the competitive profile is strictly positive and still uniquely maximizes the product of utilities. If the zero profile is unfeasible (for instance, if all items are bads), the competitive profiles are strictly negative and are the critical points of the product of disutilities on the efficiency frontier. The latter allows for multiple competitive utility profiles, from which no single-valued selection can be continuous or resource monotonic. Thus the implementation of competitive fairness under linear preferences in interactive platforms like SPLIDDIT will be more difficult when the manna contains bads that overwhelm the goods.","Anna Bogomolnaia, Hervé Moulin, Fedor Sandomirskiy and Elena Yanovskaya",Anna Bogomolnaia,Hervé Moulin,Fedor Sandomirskiy,Elena Yanovskaya,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We exploit quasi-random from Indonesia: Soeharto-regime mayors were allowed to finish their terms before being replaced by new leaders. Since mayors' political cycles were not synchronized, this event generated exogenous variation in how long old-regime mayors remained in their position during the democratic transition. Districts with longer exposure to old-regime mayors experience worse governance outcomes, higher elite persistence, and lower political competition in the medium run.

We use these methods to evaluate charter schools in Denver, one of a growing number of districts that combine charter and traditional public schools in a unified assignment system. The resulting estimates show large achievement gains from charter school attendance. Our approach generates efficiency gains over ad hoc methods, such as those that focus on schools ranked first, while also identifying a more representative average causal effect.

Comparing individuals from the Kuba Kingdom to those from just outside the Kingdom, we find that centralized formal institutions are associated with weaker norms of rule following and a greater propensity to cheat for material gain. This finding is consistent with recent models where endogenous investments to inculcate values in children decline when there is an increase in the effectiveness of formal institutions that enforce socially desirable behavior.

Using the equilibrium conditions, we perform an empirical analysis using data on the Second Congo War, a conflict that involves many groups in a complex network of informal alliances and rivalries. The estimates of the fighting externalities are then used to infer the extent to which the conflict intensity can be reduced through (i) dismantling specific fighting groups involved in the conflict; (ii) weapon embargoes; (iii) interventions aimed at pacifying animosity among groups. Finally, with the aid of a random utility model, we study how policy shocks can induce a reshaping of the network structure.","Michael D.

Our axioms deliver a new class of altruistic, forward-looking preferences, whose weight put on the consumption of a future generation generally depends on the consumption of other generations. The only preferences lacking this dependence correspond to the quasihyperbolic discounting model, which our theory characterizes.

Others argue that social justice is primarily about the distribution of commodities assigned to individuals, rather than their subjective satisfaction or happiness. In this paper, we propose and axiomatically characterize a criterion, named opportunity-equivalent utilitarian, that addresses these claims. First, our criterion ranks social alternatives on the basis of individuals' ordinal preferences. Second, it compares individuals based on the fairness of their assignments.

In this paper, we explore the possibility of imposing shape restrictions to improve the performance of the NPIV estimators. We assume that the function to be estimated is monotone and consider a sieve estimator that enforces this monotonicity constraint. We define a constrained measure of ill-posedness that is relevant for the constrained estimator and show that, under a monotone IV assumption and certain other mild regularity conditions, this measure is bounded uniformly over the dimension of the sieve space. This finding is in stark contrast to the well-known result that the unconstrained sieve measure of illposedness that is relevant for the unconstrained estimator grows to infinity with the dimension of the sieve space. Based on this result, we derive a novel non-asymptotic error bound for the constrained estimator. The bound gives a set of data-generating processes for which the monotonicity constraint has a particularly strong regularization effect and considerably improves the performance of the estimator. The form of the bound implies that the regularization effect can be strong even in large samples and even if the function to be estimated is steep, particularly so if the NPIV model is severely ill-posed. Our simulation study confirms these findings and reveals the potential for large performance gains from imposing the monotonicity constraint.",Denis Chetverikov and Daniel Wilhelm,Denis Chetverikov,Daniel Wilhelm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Consumption is modeled as an age-dependent non-linear function of assets, unobservable tastes, and the two earnings components. We establish the nonparametric identification of the nonlinear earnings process and of the consumption policy rule. Exploiting the enhanced consumption and asset data in recent waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that the earnings process features nonlinear persistence and conditional skewness. We confirm these results using population register data from Norway. We then show that the impact of earnings shocks varies substantially across earnings histories, and that this nonlinearity drives heterogeneous consumption responses. The framework provides new empirical measures of partial insurance in which the transmission of income shocks to consumption varies systematically with assets, the level of the shock, and the history of past shocks.","Manuel Arellano, Richard Blundell and Stéphane Bonhomme",Manuel Arellano,Richard Blundell,Stéphane Bonhomme,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Under mild assumptions, the network formation process is a potential game and converges to an exponential random graph model (ERGM), generating directed dense networks. I provide new identification results for ERGMs in large networks: if link externalities are nonnegative, the ERGM is asymptotically indistinguishable from an Erdős-Rényi model with independent links. We can identify the parameters only when at least one of the externalities is negative and sufficiently large. However, the standard estimation methods for ERGMs can have exponentially slow convergence, even when the model has asymptotically independent links.

The reason is the existence of two distinct mechanisms of property protection. One is formal constraints that allow individuals or groups to block any redistribution that is not in their favor. The other occurs in equilibrium where players without such powers protect each other from redistribution. Players without formal veto power anticipate that the expropriation of other similar players will ultimately hurt them and thus combine their influence to prevent redistributions. In a stable allocation, the society exhibits a ""class"" structure with class members having equal wealth and strategically protecting each other from redistribution.","Daniel Diermeier, Georgy Egorov and Konstantin Sonin",Daniel Diermeier,Georgy Egorov,Konstantin Sonin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Applying these new methods to a simple timing game, we find strikingly large gaps in behavior between discrete and continuous time as the theory suggests. Reintroducing natural inertia into these games causes continuous time behavior to collapse to discrete time-like levels in some settings as predicted by subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. However, contra this prediction, the strength of this effect is fundamentally shaped by the severity of inertia: behavior tends towards discrete time benchmarks as inertia grows large and perfectly continuous time benchmarks as it falls towards zero.

Monetary policy plays a key role in offsetting the negative impact of uncertainty shocks during normal times. Higher uncertainty has even more negative effects if monetary policy can no longer perform its usual stabilizing function because of the zero lower bound. We calibrate our uncertainty shock process using fluctuations in implied stock market volatility, and show that the model with nominal price rigidity is consistent with empirical evidence from a structural vector autoregression.

Multiple values of unobserved variables can be associated with particular combinations of observed variables. This can arise when there are multiple sources of heterogeneity, censored or discrete endogenous variables, or inequality restrictions on functions of observed and unobserved variables. The models generalize the class of incomplete instrumental variable (IV) models in which unobserved variables are single-valued functions of observed variables. Thus the models are referred to as generalized IV (GIV) models, but there are important cases in which instrumental variable restrictions play no significant role. Building on a definition of observational equivalence for incomplete models the development uses results from random set theory that guarantee that the characterizations deliver sharp bounds, thereby dispensing with the need for case-by-case proofs of sharpness. The use of random sets defined on the space of unobserved variables allows identification analysis under mean and quantile independence restrictions on the distributions of unobserved variables conditional on exogenous variables as well as under a full independence restriction.

Our lower-bound error analysis is complementary to the conventional upper-error (worst-case) bound analysis, which provides a sufficient condition for accuracy. As an illustration of our methodology, we assess approximation in the first- and second-order perturbation solutions for two stylized models: a neoclassical growth model and a new Keynesian model.

An important application of this idea is in settings where the data may be grouped into a fixed number of ""clusters"" with a large number of observations within each cluster. In such settings, we show that the distribution of the observed data satisfies our approximate symmetry requirement under weak assumptions.

To understand and measure this trade-off, we estimate a model of employer-insurer and hospitalinsurer bargaining over premiums and reimbursements, household demand for insurance, and individual demand for hospitals using detailed California admissions, claims, and enrollment data. We simulate the removal of both large and small insurers from consumers' choice sets. Although consumer welfare decreases and premiums typically increase, we find that premiums can fall upon the removal of a small insurer if an employer imposes effective premium constraints through negotiations with the remaining insurers.

This paper argues that this is because the coverage error of traditional confidence intervals is driven by the number of observations in the areas of limited overlap. Some of these ""local sample sizes"" can be very small in applications, up to the point that distributional approximations derived from classical asymptotic theory become unreliable. Building on this observation, this paper constructs confidence intervals based on classical approaches to small sample inference. The approach is easy to implement, and has superior theoretical and practical properties relative to standard methods in empirically relevant settings.",Christoph Rothe,Christoph Rothe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Equilibrium corresponds to the limit of a differentiated products Bertrand game. We apply the model to establish theoretical results on the equilibrium effects of mandates.

However, estimating the standard error of these estimators is often challenging. The root of the problem is that traditionally, standard errors rely on estimating a theoretically derived asymptotic variance, and often this asymptotic variance involves substantially more complex quantities than the original parameter to be estimated. Standard errors are important: they are used to assess the precision of estimators in the form of confidence intervals, to create ""feasible statistics"" for testing, to build forecasting models based on, say, daily estimates, and also to optimize the tuning parameters. The contribution of this paper is to provide an alternative and general solution to this problem, which we call Observed Asymptotic Variance. It is a general nonparametric method for assessing asymptotic variance (AVAR). It provides consistent estimators of AVAR for a broad class of integrated parameters Θ = ʃ θt, dt, where the spot parameter process θ can be a general semimartingale, with continuous and jump components. The observed AVAR is implemented with the help of a two-scales method. Its construction works well in the presence of microstructure noise, and when the observation times are irregular or asynchronous in the multivariate case. The methodology is valid for a wide variety of estimators, including the standard ones for variance and covariance, and also for more complex estimators, such as, of leverage effects, high frequency betas, and semivariance.",Per A.

We can handle very many control variables, endogenous receipt of treatment, heterogeneous treatment effects, and function-valued outcomes. Our framework covers the special case of exogenous receipt of treatment, either conditional on controls or unconditionally as in randomized control trials. In the latter case, our approach produces efficient estimators and honest bands for (functional) average treatment effects (ATE) and quantile treatment effects (QTE). To make informative inference possible, we assume that key reduced-form predictive relationships are approximately sparse. This assumption allows the use of regularization and selection methods to estimate those relations, and we provide methods for postregularization and post-selection inference that are uniformly valid (honest) across a wide range of models. We show that a key ingredient enabling honest inference is the use of orthogonal or doubly robust moment conditions in estimating certain reducedform functional parameters. We illustrate the use of the proposed methods with an application to estimating the effect of 401(k) eligibility and participation on accumulated assets. The results on program evaluation are obtained as a consequence of more general results on honest inference in a general moment-condition framework, which arises from structural equation models in econometrics. Here, too, the crucial ingredient is the use of orthogonal moment conditions, which can be constructed from the initial moment conditions. We provide results on honest inference for (function-valued) parameters within this general framework where any high-quality, machine learning methods (e.g., boosted trees, deep neural networks, random forest, and their aggregated and hybrid versions) can be used to learn the nonparametric/high-dimensional components of the model.

Of particular interest is the case of contingent capital for banks, in the form of debt that converts to equity, when conversion is triggered by a decline in the bank's stock price. We analyze the problem of existence and uniqueness of equilibrium values for a firm's liabilities in this context, meaning values consistent with a market-price trigger. Discrete-time dynamics allow multiple equilibria. In contrast, we show that the possibility of multiple equilibria can largely be ruled out in continuous time, where the price of the triggering security adjusts in anticipation of breaching the trigger. Our main condition for existence of an equilibrium requires that the consequences of triggering a conversion be consistent with the direction in which the trigger is crossed. For the design of contingent capital with a stock price trigger, this condition may be interpreted to mean that conversion should be disadvantageous to shareholders, and it is satisfied by setting the trigger sufficiently high. Uniqueness follows provided the trigger is sufficiently accessible by all candidate equilibria.

Two approaches are considered—penalized profile likelihood (PPL) estimation for the general nonlinear models without endogenous regressors, and penalized GMM (PGMM) estimation for linear models with endogeneity. In both cases, we develop a new variant of Lasso called classifier-Lasso (C-Lasso) that serves to shrink individual coefficients to the unknown group-specific coefficients. C-Lasso achieves simultaneous classification and consistent estimation in a single step and the classification exhibits the desirable property of uniform consistency. For PPL estimation, C-Lasso also achieves the oracle property so that group-specific parameter estimators are asymptotically equivalent to infeasible estimators that use individual group identity information. For PGMM estimation, the oracle property of C-Lasso is preserved in some special cases. Simulations demonstrate good finite-sample performance of the approach in both classification and estimation.

These assumptions, which are the foundation of a large literature in labor and development, have been tested and not rejected in several important studies including Benjamin (1992). Using multiple waves of longitudinal survey data from Central Java, Indonesia, this paper tests a key prediction of the recursive model: demand for farm labor is unrelated to the demographic composition of the farm household. The prediction is unambiguously rejected. The rejection cannot be explained by contamination due to unobserved heterogeneity that is fixed at the farm level, local area shocks, or farm-specific shocks that affect changes in household composition and farm labor demand.

The reason is that product characteristic instruments achieve identification through correlation with markups, and, depending on the model of demand, the supply side can constrain markups to converge to a constant quickly relative to sampling error. I find that product characteristic instruments can yield consistent estimates in many of the cases I consider, but care must be taken in modeling demand and choosing instruments. A Monte Carlo study confirms that the asymptotic results are relevant in market sizes of practical importance.",Timothy B. Armstrong,Timothy B. Armstrong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We exploit quantity and price information to disentangle markups from quantity-based productivity, and then compute marginal costs by dividing observed prices by the estimated markups. We use India's trade liberalization episode to examine how firms adjust these performance measures. Not surprisingly, we find that trade liberalization lowers factory-gate prices and that output tariff declines have the expected pro-competitive effects. However, the price declines are small relative to the declines in marginal costs, which fall predominantly because of the input tariff liberalization. The reason for this incomplete cost pass-through to prices is that firms offset their reductions in marginal costs by raising markups. Our results demonstrate substantial heterogeneity and variability in markups across firms and time and suggest that producers benefited relative to consumers, at least immediately after the reforms.","Jan De Loecker, Pinelopi K.

The predictions about fund portfolios' covariance with payoff shocks, cross-fund portfolio and return dispersion, and their excess returns are all supported by the data.

This finding is robust to various checks including using the number of small rivers and short-run exam performance before the quota system as instruments. The patterns in the data appear most consistent with the interpretation that in regions with higher quotas per capita under the exam system, more would-be elites were negatively affected by the abolition.

The adjustment for the ATE estimator is negative (or zero in some special cases), implying that matching on the estimated propensity score is more efficient than matching on the true propensity score in large samples.

Because of the presence of grouplevel unobservables, standard quantile regression techniques are inconsistent in our setting even if the treatment is independent of unobservables. In contrast, our estimation technique is consistent as well as computationally simple, consisting of group-by-group quantile regression followed by two-stage least squares. Using the Bahadur representation of quantile estimators, we derive weak conditions on the growth of the number of observations per group that are sufficient for consistency and asymptotic zero-mean normality of our estimator. As in Hausman and Taylor (1981), micro-level covariates can be used as internal instruments for the endogenous group-level treatment if they satisfy relevance and exogeneity conditions. Our approach applies to a broad range of settings including labor, public finance, industrial organization, urban economics, and development; we illustrate its usefulness with several such examples.

Unlike habit formation and other theories, but consistent with empirical evidence, the consumption commitments model also predicts that excess sensitivity and smoothness vanish for large shocks. These results suggest that behavior previously attributed to habit formation may be better explained by adjustment costs. We develop additional testable predictions to further distinguish the commitment and habit models and show that the two models have different welfare implications.",Raj Chetty and Adam Szeidl,Raj Chetty,Adam Szeidl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

In natural environments, we show the economy does not need both: if credit is easy, money is irrelevant; if credit is tight, money is essential, but credit becomes irrelevant. Changes in credit conditions are neutral because real balances respond endogenously to keep total liquidity constant. This is true for both exogenous and endogenous debt limits and policy limits, secured and unsecured lending, and general pricing mechanisms. While we show how to overturn some of these results, the benchmark model suggests credit might matter less than people think.","Chao Gu, Fabrizio Mattesini and Randall Wright",Chao Gu,Fabrizio Mattesini,Randall Wright,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We put forward a model that merges the standard incomplete-markets model of consumption and inequality with the new Keynesian model of nominal rigidities and business cycles, and that includes most of the main potential stabilizers in the U.S. data and the theoretical channels by which they may work. We find that the conventional argument that stabilizing disposable income will stabilize aggregate demand plays a negligible role in the dynamics of the business cycle, whereas tax-and-transfer programs that affect inequality and social insurance can have a larger effect on aggregate volatility. However, as currently designed, the set of stabilizers in place in the United States has had little effect on the volatility of aggregate output fluctuations or on their welfare costs despite stabilizing aggregate consumption. The stabilizers have a more important role when monetary policy is constrained by the zero lower bound, and they affect welfare significantly through the provision of social insurance.",Alisdair McKay and Ricardo Reis,Alisdair McKay,Ricardo Reis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

To minimize costs, a governor's rewards for good performance should be deferred up to the maximal credit that the prince can be trusted to pay. In the long run, we find that high officials can become an entrenched aristocracy with low turnover and large claims on the ruler. Dismissals for bad performance should be randomized to avoid inciting rebellions, but the prince can profit from reselling vacant offices, and so his decisions to dismiss high officials require institutionalized monitoring.

In larger firms, and for more highly ranked executives, weaker signal quality about effort results in higher risk premiums. This risk premium accounts for roughly 80 percent of the firm-size gap in total compensation. Larger firms are also willing to pay more than smaller ones to attract executives. Finally, the estimated coefficients on human capital accumulation from formal education and experience gained from different firms are individually significant, but their collective effect on firm-size pay differentials nets out.","George-Levi Gayle, Limor Golan and Robert A.

This paper presents a framework where this idea can be justified. The point of departure is the observation that a large firm typically faces endogenous risks that may have a significant impact on the workers it employs and the consumers it serves. These risks generate externalities on these stakeholders which are not internalized by shareholders. As a result, in the competitive equilibrium, there is underinvestment in the prevention of these risks. We suggest that this under-investment problem can be alleviated if firms are instructed to maximize the total welfare of their stakeholders rather than shareholder value alone (stakeholder equilibrium). The stakeholder equilibrium can be implemented by introducing new property rights (employee rights and consumer rights) and instructing managers to maximize the total value of the firm (the value of these rights plus shareholder value). If there is only one firm, the stakeholder equilibrium is Pareto optimal. However, this is not true with more than one firm and/or heterogeneous agents, which illustrates some of the limits of the stakeholder model.","Michael Magill, Martine Quinzii and Jean-Charles Rochet",Michael Magill,Martine Quinzii,Jean-Charles Rochet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Thus, even temporary policies that initiate accumulation among the poor may be effective. We examine implications concerning the effect of access to credit on saving, the demand for commitment devices, the design of financial accounts to promote accumulation, and the variation of the marginal propensity to consume across income from different sources. We also explore the nature of optimal self-control, demonstrating that it has a simple and behaviorally plausible structure that is immune to self-renegotiation.","B.

(i) We develop a simpler analytical characterization and numerical algorithm for Bayesian inference in structural vector autoregressions (VARs) that can be used for models that are overidentified, just-identified, or underidentified. (ii) We analyze the asymptotic properties of Bayesian inference and show that in the underidentified case, the asymptotic posterior distribution of contemporaneous coefficients in an n-variable VAR is confined to the set of values that orthogonalize the population variance-covariance matrix of ordinary least squares residuals, with the height of the posterior proportional to the height of the prior at any point within that set. For example, in a bivariate VAR for supply and demand identified solely by sign restrictions, if the population correlation between the VAR residuals is positive, then even if one has available an infinite sample of data, any inference about the demand elasticity is coming exclusively from the prior distribution. (iii) We provide analytical characterizations of the informative prior distributions for impulse-response functions that are implicit in the traditional sign-restriction approach to VARs, and we note, as a special case of result (ii), that the influence of these priors does not vanish asymptotically. (iv) We illustrate how Bayesian inference with informative priors can be both a strict generalization and an unambiguous improvement over frequentist inference in just-identified models.

We get these bounds by applying revealed preference restrictions implied by the collective model to the household's continuous aggregate demand functions. We obtain informative bounds even if nothing is known about whether each good is public, private, or assignable within the household, though having such information tightens the bounds. We apply our method to US PSID data, obtaining narrow bounds that yield useful conclusions regarding the effects of income and wages on intrahousehold resource sharing, and on the prevalence of individual (as opposed to household level) poverty.","Laurens Cherchye, Bram De Rock, Arthur Lewbel and Frederic Vermeulen",Laurens Cherchye,Bram De Rock,Arthur Lewbel,Frederic Vermeulen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We show that trade creditors experience significant trade credit losses due to trade debtor failures and that creditors' bankruptcy risks increase in the size of incurred losses. By exploring the roles of financial constraints and creditor-debtor dependences, we infer that the trade credit failure propagation mechanism is driven by both credit losses and demand shrinkage. Finally, we show that the documented propagation mechanism constitutes a significant part of the overall bankruptcy frequency, suggesting that it has measurable implications for the aggregate level.",Tor Jacobson and Erik von Schedvin,Tor Jacobson,Erik von Schedvin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Its primary objective is to estimate gains by age from being married today (till death of at least one spouse) relative to remaining single for that same time period. An empirical methodology that relies on the model's equilibrium outcomes identifies the marriage gains using a single cross-section of observed aggregate matches. This behavioral dynamic model rationalizes a new marriage matching function. The model also solves the inverse problem of computing the vector of aggregate marriages, given a new distribution of available single individuals and estimated preferences. Finally, this paper develops a simple test of the model's empirical validity. Using aggregate data of new marriages and available single men and women in the United States over two decades from 1970 to 1990,I investigate the changes in marriage gains over this period.",Eugene Choo,Eugene Choo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

To solve this problem, the monopolist and (possibly) the planner curtail flexibility in the device for a more inconsistent person at both ends of the efficient choice range; moreover, they may have to add unused options to the device for a less inconsistent person and also distort his actual choices.

Existing tests based on quadratic forms such as the Wald statistic often suffer from low powers due to the accumulation of errors in estimating high-dimensional parameters. More powerful tests for sparse alternatives such as thresholding and extreme value tests, on the other hand, require either stringent conditions or bootstrap to derive the null distribution and often suffer from size distortions due to the slow convergence. Based on a screening technique, we introduce a ""power enhancement component,"" which is zero under the null hypothesis with high probability, but diverges quickly under sparse alternatives. The proposed test statistic combines the power enhancement component with an asymptotically pivotal statistic, and strengthens the power under sparse alternatives. The null distribution does not require stringent regularity conditions, and is completely determined by that of the pivotal statistic. The proposed methods are then applied to testing the factor pricing models and validating the cross-sectional independence in panel data models.","Jianqing Fan, Yuan Liao and Jiawei Yao",Jianqing Fan,Yuan Liao,Jiawei Yao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Additional equilibria may arise in this sunk-investment setting, even though our matching market is competitive. These equilibria exhibit inefficiencies that we can interpret as coordination failures. All allocations satisfying a constrained efficiency property are equilibria, and the converse holds if preferences satisfy a separability condition. We identify sufficient conditions (most notably, quasiconcave utilities) for the investments of matched agents to satisfy an exchange efficiency property as well as sufficient conditions (most notably, a single crossing property) for agents to be matched positive assortatively, with these conditions then forming the core of sufficient conditions for the efficiency of equilibrium allocations.",Georg Nöldeke and Larry Samuelson,Georg Nöldeke,Larry Samuelson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We show that in a large market, the inclusive value is a sufficient statistic for an agent's endogenous choice set with respect to the probability of being matched to a spouse of a given observable type. Furthermore, while the number of pairwise stable matchings for a typical realization of random utilities grows at a fast rate as the number of market participants increases, the inclusive values resulting from any stable matching converge to a unique deterministic limit. We can therefore characterize the limiting distribution of the matching market as the unique solution to a fixed-point condition on the inclusive values.

We then identify settled equilibria, which are Nash equilibria with support in minimal tenable blocks. For a generic class of normal-form games, our coarse and fine concepts are equivalent, and yet they differ from standard solution concepts on open sets of games. We demonstrate the nature and power of the solutions by way of examples. Settled equilibria are closely related to persistent equilibria but are strictly more selective on an open set of games.

This implicitly gives an objecting coalition complete power to arrange the payoffs of players elsewhere, which is clearly unsatisfactory. While this assumption is largely innocuous for myopic dominance, it is of crucial significance for its farsighted counterpart. Our modification of the Harsanyi set respects ""coalitional sovereignty."" The resulting farsighted stable set is very different from both the Harsanyi and the vNM sets. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a farsighted stable set containing just a single-payoff allocation. This condition roughly establishes an equivalence between core allocations and the union of allocations over all single-payoff farsighted stable sets.

This reformulation in turn transforms the principal's utility maximization problem into a nonlinear program. Under the additional assumptions that the principal's expected utility is a polynomial and the agent's expected utility is rational in the wage, the final nonlinear program can be solved to global optimality. The paper also shows how to first approximate expected utility functions that are not rational by polynomials, so that the polynomial optimization approach can be applied to compute an approximate solution to nonpolynomial problems.

In this paper, we solve this inference problem by showing the novel result that a bootstrap test where the null hypothesis is imposed on the bootstrap sample is asymptotically valid. That is, not only does it have asymptotically correct size, but, in contrast to what is claimed in existing literature, it is consistent under the alternative. Compared to the theory for bootstrap tests on the co-integration rank (Cavaliere, Rahbek, and Taylor (2012)), establishing the validity of the bootstrap in the framework of hypotheses on the co-integrating vectors requires new theoretical developments, including the introduction of multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes with random (reduced rank) drift parameters. Finally, as documented by Monte Carlo simulations, the bootstrap test outperforms existing methods.","Giuseppe Cavaliere, Heino Bohn Nielsen and Anders Rahbek",Giuseppe Cavaliere,Heino Bohn Nielsen,Anders Rahbek,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The methods are developed by directly connecting the elements of the structural system to be estimated with features of the density of the observable variables, such as ratios of derivatives or averages of products of derivatives of this density. The estimators are therefore easily computed functionals of a nonparametric estimator of the density of the observable variables. We consider in detail a model where to each structural equation there corresponds an exclusive regressor and a model with one equation of interest and one instrument that is included in a second equation. For both models, we provide new characterizations of observational equivalence on a set, in terms of the density of the observable variables and derivatives of the structural functions. Based on those characterizations, we develop two estimation methods. In the first method, the estimators of the structural derivatives are calculated by a simple matrix inversion and matrix multiplication, analogous to a standard least squares estimator, but with the elements of the matrices being averages of products of derivatives of non-parametric density estimators. In the second method, the estimators of the structural derivatives are calculated in two steps. In a first step, values of the instrument are found at which the density of the observable variables satisfies some properties. In the second step, the estimators are calculated directly from the values of derivatives of the density of the observable variables evaluated at the found values of the instrument. We show that both pointwise estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal.",Rosa L. Matzkin,Rosa L. Matzkin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Using detailed new data, I show that this shift induced the development of new technologies that augmented Indian cotton. As these new technologies became available, I show that the relative price of Indian/U.S. cotton rebounded to its pre-war level, despite the increased relative supply of Indian cotton.

We argue that aggregate durable expenditures respond more sluggishly to economic shocks during recessions because microeconomic frictions lead to declines in the frequency of households' durable adjustment. We show this by first using indirect inference to estimate a heterogeneous agent incomplete markets model with fixed costs of durable adjustment to match consumption dynamics in PSID microdata. We then show that aggregating this model delivers an extremely procyclical Impulse Response Function (IRF) of durable spending to aggregate shocks. For example, the response of durable spending to an income shock in 1999 is estimated to be almost twice as large as if it occurred in 2009. This procyclical IRF holds in response to standard business cycle shocks as well as in response to various policy shocks, and it is robust to general equilibrium.

The data reveal that the large majority of our subjects intrinsically value decision rights beyond their instrumental benefit. The intrinsic valuation of decision rights has potentially important consequences for corporate governance, human resource management, and optimal job design: it may explain why managers value power, why employees appreciate jobs with task discretion, why individuals sort into self-employment, and why the reallocation of decision rights is often very difficult and cumbersome.

I show that introducing information frictions reconciles the theory with the observed patterns in the data.

We accomplish this task by using indirect inference to estimate a structural consumption-savings model, in which individuals both learn about the nature of their income process and partly insure shocks via informal mechanisms. In this framework, we estimate (i) the degree of partial insurance, (ii) the extent of systematic differences in income growth rates, (iii) the precision with which individuals know their own income growth rates when they begin their working lives, (iv) the persistence of typical labor income shocks, (v) the tightness of borrowing constraints, and (vi) the amount of measurement error in the data. In implementing indirect inference, we find that an auxiliary model that approximates the true structural equations of the model (which are not estimable) works very well, with negligible small sample bias. The main substantive findings are that income shocks are moderately persistent, systematic differences in income growth rates are large, individuals have substantial amounts of information about their income growth rates, and about one-half of income shocks are smoothed via partial insurance. Putting these findings together, the amount of uninsurable lifetime income risk that individuals perceive is substantially smaller than what is typically assumed in calibrated macroeconomic models with incomplete markets.","Fatih Guvenen and Anthony A.

When survival and profit maximization are sharply at odds (LS parameters), subjects persistently (and sub-optimally) hoard excess cash in an evident effort to improve survival rates.

In this design, local polynomial estimators are now routinely employed to construct confidence intervals for treatment effects. The performance of these confidence intervals in applications, however, may be seriously hampered by their sensitivity to the specific bandwidth employed. Available bandwidth selectors typically yield a ""large"" bandwidth, leading to data-driven confidence intervals that may be biased, with empirical coverage well below their nominal target. We propose new theory-based, more robust confidence interval estimators for average treatment effects at the cutoff in sharp RD, sharp kink RD, fuzzy RD, and fuzzy kink RD designs. Our proposed confidence intervals are constructed using a bias-corrected RD estimator together with a novel standard error estimator. For practical implementation, we discuss mean squared error optimal bandwidths, which are by construction not valid for conventional confidence intervals but are valid with our robust approach, and consistent standard error estimators based on our new variance formulas. In a special case of practical interest, our procedure amounts to running a quadratic instead of a linear local regression. More generally, our results give a formal justification to simple inference procedures based on increasing the order of the local polynomial estimator employed. We find in a simulation study that our confidence intervals exhibit close-to-correct empirical coverage and good empirical interval length on average, remarkably improving upon the alternatives available in the literature.

We analyze the optimal fiscal rule when the shocks are persistent. Unlike under independent and identically distributed shocks, we show that the ex ante optimal rule is not sequentially optimal, as it provides dynamic incentives. The ex ante optimal rule exhibits history dependence, with high shocks leading to an erosion of future fiscal discipline compared to low shocks, which lead to the reinstatement of discipline.

We examine behavior and equilibrium selection. The degree of equilibrium play is striking, in particular with incomplete information. Behavior closely resembles the theoretical equilibrium whenever this is unique; when there are multiple equilibria, general features of networks, such as connectivity, clustering, and the degree of the players, help to predict informed behavior in the lab. People appear to be strongly attracted to maximizing aggregate payoffs (social efficiency), but there are forces that moderate this attraction: (1) people seem content with (in the aggregate) capturing only the lion's share of the efficient profits in exchange for reduced exposure to loss, and (2) uncertainty about the network structure makes it considerably more difficult to coordinate on a demanding, but efficient, equilibrium that is typically implemented with complete information.","Gary Charness, Francesco Feri, Miguel A.

The incentive induces 22% of households to send a seasonal migrant, their consumption at the origin increases significantly, and treated households are 8–10 percentage points more likely to re-migrate 1 and 3 years after the incentive is removed. These facts can be explained qualitatively by a model in which migration is risky, mitigating risk requires individual-specific learning, and some migrants are sufficiently close to subsistence that failed migration is very costly. We document evidence consistent with this model using heterogeneity analysis and additional experimental variation, but calibrations with forward-looking households that can save up to migrate suggest that it is difficult for the model to quantitatively match the data.

While a majority of the population seems to exhibit both risk aversion and these higher order risk preferences, a significant minority does not. We show how both risk-averse and risk-loving behaviors might be generated by a simple type of basic lottery preference for either (1) combining ""good"" outcomes with ""bad"" ones, or (2) combining ""good with good"" and ""bad with bad,"" respectively. We further show that this dichotomy is fairly robust at explaining higher order risk attitudes in the laboratory. In addition to our own experimental evidence, we take a second look at the extant laboratory experiments that measure higher order risk preferences and we find a fair amount of support for this dichotomy. Our own experiment also is the first to look beyond fourth-order risk preferences, and we examine risk attitudes at even higher orders.",Cary Deck and Harris Schlesinger,Cary Deck,Harris Schlesinger,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

These results allow us to interpret relevant measures as reflecting part of perceived ambiguity, meaning subjective uncertainty about probabilities over states. Under mild conditions, we show that increases or decreases in ambiguity aversion cannot affect the relevant measures. This property, necessary for the conclusion that these measures reflect only perceived ambiguity, distinguishes the set of relevant measures from the leading alternative in the literature. We apply our findings to a number of well-known models of ambiguity-sensitive preferences.

To interpret this fact, we develop a structural economic model where households can hold two assets: a low-return liquid asset (e.g., cash, checking account) and a high-return illiquid asset that carries a transaction cost (e.g., housing, retirement account). The optimal life-cycle pattern of portfolio choice implies that many households in the model are ""wealthy hand-to-mouth"": they hold little or no liquid wealth despite owning sizable quantities of illiquid assets. Therefore, they display large propensities to consume out of additional transitory income, and small propensities to consume out of news about future income. We document the existence of such households in data from the Survey of Consumer Finances. A version of the model parameterized to the 2001 tax rebate episode yields consumption responses to fiscal stimulus payments that are in line with the evidence, and an order of magnitude larger than in the standard ""one-asset"" framework. The model's nonlinearities with respect to the rebate size and the prevailing aggregate economic conditions have implications for policy design.",Greg Kaplan and Giovanni L.

When someone purchases an asset, his peers may also want to purchase it, both because they learn from his choice (""social learning"") and because his possession of the asset directly affects others' utility of owning the same asset (""social utility""). We randomize whether one member of a peer pair who chose to purchase an asset has that choice implemented, thus randomizing his ability to possess the asset. Then, we randomize whether the second member of the pair: (i) receives no information about the first member, or (ii) is informed of the first member's desire to purchase the asset and the result of the randomization that determined possession. This allows us to estimate the effects of learning plus possession, and learning alone, relative to a (no information) control group. We find that both social learning and social utility channels have statistically and economically significant effects on investment decisions. Evidence from a follow-up survey reveals that social learning effects are greatest when the first (second) investor is financially sophisticated (financially unsophisticated); investors report updating their beliefs about asset quality after learning about their peer's revealed preference; and, they report motivations consistent with ""keeping up with the Joneses"" when learning about their peer's possession of the asset. These results can help shed light on the mechanisms underlying herding behavior in financial markets and peer effects in consumption and investment decisions.","Leonardo Bursztyn, Florian Ederer, Bruno Ferman and Noam Yuchtman",Leonardo Bursztyn,Florian Ederer,Bruno Ferman,Noam Yuchtman,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We find that the firm-specific component contributes substantially to aggregate sales volatility, mattering about as much as the components capturing shocks that are common across firms within a sector or country. We then decompose the firm-specific component to provide evidence on two mechanisms that generate aggregate fluctuations from microeconomic shocks highlighted in the recent literature: (i) when the firm size distribution is fat-tailed, idiosyncratic shocks to large firms directly contribute to aggregate fluctuations, and (ii) aggregate fluctuations can arise from idiosyncratic shocks due to input—output linkages across the economy. Firm linkages are approximately three times as important as the direct effect of firm shocks in driving aggregate fluctuations.","Julian di Giovanni, Andrei A.

Using this decomposition, we arrive at a novel strategy for estimating a plausibly causal effect of land use regulation on land value and welfare. This strategy exploits cross-border changes in development, prices, and regulation in regions near municipal borders.

Corporate default decisions interact with the endogenous secondary market liquidity via the rollover channel. A default-liquidity loop arises: Assuming a relative illiquid secondary bond market in default, earlier endogenous default worsens a bond's secondary market liquidity, which amplifies equity holders' rollover losses, which in turn leads to earlier endogenous default. Besides characterizing in closed form the full interdependence between liquidity and default for credit spreads, our calibrated model can jointly match empirically observed credit spreads and liquidity measures of bonds across different rating classes.",Zhiguo He and Konstantin Milbradt,Zhiguo He,Konstantin Milbradt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The model's estimates yield median costs of mobility ranging from 1.4 to 2.7 times annual average wages, but a high dispersion of these costs across the population. In addition, sector-specific experience is imperfectly transferable across sectors, leading to additional barriers to mobility. Using the estimated model for counterfactual trade liberalization experiments, the main findings are: (1) there is a large labor market response following trade liberalization but the transition may take several years; (2) potential aggregate welfare gains are significantly reduced due to the delayed adjustment; (3) trade-induced welfare effects depend on initial sector of employment and on worker demographics such as age and education.

Failure at the boundary implies that these CIs have zero asymptotic coverage probability in the stationary case and vicinities of unity that are wider than O(n -1/3 ). The inversion methods of Hansen (1999) and Mikusheva (2007) are asymptotically valid in such cases. Implications of these results for predictive regression tests are explored. When the predictive regressor is stationary, the popular Campbell and Yogo (2006) CIs for the regression coefficient have zero coverage probability asymptotically, and their predictive test statistic Q erroneously indicates predictability with probability approaching unity when the null of no predictability holds.

We axiomatize a recursive representation of choice over state contingent infinite horizon consumption problems, where uncertainty about consumption utilities depends on the observable state and the state follows a subjective Markov process. The parameters of the representation are the subjective process that governs the evolution of beliefs over consumption utilities and the discount factor; they are uniquely identified from behavior. We characterize a natural notion of greater preference for flexibility in terms of a dilation of beliefs. An important special case of our representation is a recursive version of the Anscombe–Aumann model with parameters that include a subjective Markov process over states and state-dependent utilities, all of which are uniquely identified.",R.

Controlling for tenure, the probability of a worker leaving the firm decreases with seniority. The increase in expected seniority with tenure explains a large part of the negative duration dependence of the separation hazard. Conditional on ten years of tenure, the wage differential between the 10th and the 90th percentiles of the seniority distribution is 1.1–1.4 percentage points in Denmark and 2.3–3.4 in Portugal.","I.

Our testing procedure covers the class of Hamilton's models, where the parameters vary according to an unobservable Markov chain, but also applies to nonlinear models where the random coefficients need not be Markov. We show that the contiguous alternatives converge to the null hypothesis at a rate that is slower than the standard rate. Therefore, standard approaches do not apply. We use Bartlett-type identities for the construction of the test statistics. This has several desirable properties. First, it only requires estimating the model under the null hypothesis where the parameters are constant. Second, the proposed test is asymptotically optimal in the sense that it maximizes a weighted power function. We derive the asymptotic distribution of our test under the null and local alternatives. Asymptotically valid bootstrap critical values are also proposed.","Marine Carrasco, Liang Hu and Werner Ploberger",Marine Carrasco,Liang Hu,Werner Ploberger,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Our central result is a simple formula for the marginal externality damage of emissions (or, equivalently, for the optimal carbon tax). This formula, which holds under quite plausible assumptions, reveals that the damage is proportional to current GDP, with the proportion depending only on three factors: (i) discounting, (ii) the expected damage elasticity (how many percent of the output flow is lost from an extra unit of carbon in the atmosphere), and (iii) the structure of carbon depreciation in the atmosphere. Thus, the stochastic values of future output, consumption, and the atmospheric CO 2 concentration, as well as the paths of technology (whether endogenous or exogenous) and population, and so on, all disappear from the formula. We find that the optimal tax should be a bit higher than the median, or most well-known, estimates in the literature. We also formulate a parsimonious yet comprehensive and easily solved model allowing us to compute the optimal and market paths for the use of different sources of energy and the corresponding climate change. We find coal—rather than oil—to be the main threat to economic welfare, largely due to its abundance. We also find that the costs of inaction are particularly sensitive to the assumptions regarding the substitutability of different energy sources and technological progress.","Mikhail Golosov, John Hassler, Per Krusell and Aleh Tsyvinski",Mikhail Golosov,John Hassler,Per Krusell,Aleh Tsyvinski,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

This paper uses a fuzzy regression-discontinuity design to evaluate the causal effects of peer characteristics. Our design exploits admissions cutoffs at Boston and New York City's heavily over-subscribed exam schools. Successful applicants near admissions cutoffs for the least selective of these schools move from schools with scores near the bottom of the state SAT score distribution to schools with scores near the median. Successful applicants near admissions cutoffs for the most selective of these schools move from above-average schools to schools with students whose scores fall in the extreme upper tail. Exam school students can also expect to study with fewer nonwhite classmates than unsuccessful applicants.

A common fear among development practitioners is that one-off subsidies may negatively affect long-run adoption through reference-dependence: People might anchor around the subsidized price and be unwilling to pay more for the product later. But for experience goods, one-off subsidies could also boost long-run adoption through learning. This paper uses data from a two-stage randomized pricing experiment in Kenya to estimate the relative importance of these effects for a new, improved antimalarial bed net. Reduced form estimates show that a one-time subsidy has a positive impact on willingness to pay a year later inherit. To separately identify the learning and anchoring effects, we estimate a parsimonious experience-good model. Estimation results show a large, positive learning effect but no anchoring.

Several countries have recently experienced Islamic parties coming to power through democratic elections.

Whether this reflects a causal relationship or a spurious one has so far gone unexplored. I provide the first piece of evidence using a new and unique data set of Turkish municipalities. In 1994, an Islamic party won multiple municipal mayor seats across the country. Using a regression discontinuity (RD) design, I compare municipalities where this Islamic party barely won or lost elections. Despite negative raw correlations, the RD results reveal that, over a period of six years, Islamic rule increased female secular high school education. Corresponding effects for men are systematically smaller and less precise. In the longer run, the effect on female education remained persistent up to 17 years after, and also reduced adolescent marriages. An analysis of long-run political effects of Islamic rule shows increased female political participation and an overall decrease in Islamic political preferences. The results are consistent with an explanation that emphasizes the Islamic party's effectiveness in overcoming barriers to female entry for the poor and pious.",Erik Meyersson,Erik Meyersson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

For such games, we establish sufficient conditions for existence of a value of the game, maximin and minimax strategies for the players, and a Nash equilibrium. If all discontinuities favor one player, then a value exists and that player has a maximin strategy. A property called payoff approachability implies existence of an equilibrium, and that the resulting value is invariant: games with the same payoffs at points of continuity have the same value and ε-equilibria. For voting games in which two candidates propose policies and a candidate wins election if a weighted majority of voters prefer his proposed policy, we provide tie-breaking rules and assumptions about voters' preferences sufficient to imply payoff approachability. These assumptions are satisfied by generic preferences if the dimension of the space of policies exceeds the number of voters; or with no dimensional restriction, if the electorate is sufficiently large. Each Colonel Blotto game is a special case in which each candidate allocates a resource among several constituencies and a candidate gets votes from those allocated more than his opponent offers; in this case, for simple-majority rule we prove existence of an equilibrium with zero probability of ties.","Paulo Barelli, Srihari Govindan and Robert Wilson",Paulo Barelli,Srihari Govindan,Robert Wilson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Working within the AS model, we map variation in factors affecting entry behavior (potential competition or entry costs) into identified bounds on model fundamentals. These bounds are constructive, collapse to point identification when available entry variation is continuous, and can readily be refined to produce the pointwise sharp identified set.

For either of these scenarios, we derive joint functional central limit theorems and bootstrap validity results for regression-based estimators of the status quo and counterfactual outcome distributions. These results allow us to construct simultaneous confidence sets for function-valued effects of the counterfactual changes, including the effects on the entire distribution and quantile functions of the outcome as well as on related functionals. These confidence sets can be used to test functional hypotheses such as no-effect, positive effect, or stochastic dominance. Our theory applies to general counterfactual changes and covers the main regression methods including classical, quantile, duration, and distribution regressions. We illustrate the results with an empirical application to wage decompositions using data for the United States.

Although the bargaining phase is cheap talk (following a generalized alternating-offer protocol), sharp predictions arise from three axioms. Two axioms allow the players to meaningfully discuss whether to deviate from their plan; the third embodies a ""theory of disagreement""—that play under disagreement should not vary with the manner in which bargaining broke down. Equilibria that satisfy these axioms exist for all discount factors and are simple to construct; all equilibria generate the same welfare. Optimal play under agreement generally requires suboptimal play under disagreement. Whether patient players attain efficiency depends on both the stage game and the bargaining protocol.

However, as we show, these moment conditions have a degenerate Jacobian matrix at the true parameter value and therefore the standard asymptotic results of Hansen (1982) do not apply. We show in this context that Hansen's (1982) J-test statistic is asymptotically distributed as the minimum of the limit of a certain random process with a markedly nonstandard distribution. If two assets are considered, this asymptotic distribution is a fifty—fifty mixture of ${\mathrm{\chi }}_{\mathrm{H}-1}^{2}$ and ${\mathrm{\chi }}_{\mathrm{H}}^{2}$ , where H is the number of moment conditions, as opposed to a ${\mathrm{\chi }}_{\mathrm{H}-1}^{2}$ . With more than two assets, this distribution lies between the ${\mathrm{\chi }}_{\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{p}}^{2}$ and ${\mathrm{\chi }}_{\mathrm{H}}^{2}$ (p denotes the number of parameters).

This paper argues that private information, held by the potential applicant pool, explains rejections. I formulate this argument by developing and testing a model in which agents may have private information about their risk. I first derive a new no-trade result that theoretically explains how private information could cause rejections. I then develop a new empirical methodology to test whether this no-trade condition can explain rejections. The methodology uses subjective probability elicitations as noisy measures of agents' beliefs. I apply this approach to three nongroup markets: long-term care, disability, and life insurance. Consistent with the predictions of the theory, in all three settings I find significant amounts of private information held by those who would be rejected; I find generally more private information for those who would be rejected relative to those who can purchase insurance, and I show it is enough private information to explain a complete absence of trade for those who would be rejected. The results suggest that private information prevents the existence of large segments of these three major insurance markets.",Nathaniel Hendren,Nathaniel Hendren,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

It does so by estimating and solving, using parametric approximations to firms' value functions, a dynamic model that captures important features of the industry such as vertical and horizontal product differentiation, demographic variation in programming tastes, and multi-station ownership. The estimated model predicts that high fees would cause the number of music stations to fall significantly and quite quickly. For example, a fee equal to 10% of revenues would cause a 4.6% drop in the number of music stations within $2\frac{1}{2}$ years, and a 9.4% drop in the long run. The size of the change is limited, however, by the fact that many listeners, particularly in demographics that are valued by advertisers, have strong preferences for music programming.",Andrew Sweeting,Andrew Sweeting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We consider dynamic stochastic models with general and heterogeneous bequest tastes and labor productivities. We limit ourselves to simple but realistic linear or two-bracket tax structures to obtain tractable formulas. We show that long-run optimal inheritance tax rates can always be expressed in terms of aggregate earnings and bequest elasticities with respect to tax rates, distributional parameters, and social preferences for redistribution. Those results carry over with tractable modifications to (a) the case with social discounting (instead of steady-state welfare maximization), (b) the case with partly accidental bequests, (c) the standard Barro—Becker dynastic model. The optimal tax rate is positive and quantitatively large if the elasticity of bequests to the tax rate is low, bequest concentration is high, and society cares mostly about those receiving little inheritance. We propose a calibration using micro-data for France and the United States. We find that, for realistic parameters, the optimal inheritance tax rate might be as large as 50%—60%—or even higher for top bequests, in line with historical experience.",Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez,Thomas Piketty,Emmanuel Saez,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Furthermore, the distribution of country shares, the Lorenz curve, is unique and analytically solvable in the limit, as the number of countries grows unbounded.

The empirical results suggest that the relative benefits of schooling have been increasing across cohorts of U.S. men born between 1840 and 1930.

We introduce the notion of ""connected substitutes"" and show that this structure is sufficient for invertibility. The connected substitutes conditions require weak substitution between all goods and sufficient strict substitution to necessitate treating them in a single demand system. The connected substitutes conditions have transparent economic interpretation, are easily checked, and are satisfied in many standard models. They need only hold under some transformation of demand and can accommodate many models in which goods are complements. They allow one to show invertibility without strict gross substitutes, functional form restrictions, smoothness assumptions, or strong domain restrictions.

We use bidding data from the European Central Bank's auctions for one-week loans, their main channel of monetary policy implementation. Our analysis provides a high-frequency, disaggregated perspective on the 2007 crisis, which was previously studied through comparisons of collateralized and uncollateralized interbank money market rates which do not capture the heterogeneous impact of the crisis on individual banks. Through a model of bidding, we show that banks' bids reflect their cost of obtaining short-term funds elsewhere (e.g., in the interbank market) as well as a strategic response to other bidders. The strategic response is empirically important: while a naïve interpretation of the raw bidding data may suggest that virtually all banks suffered an increase in the cost of short-term funding, we find that, for about one third of the banks, the change in bidding behavior was simply a strategic response. We also find considerable heterogeneity in the short-term funding costs among banks: for over one third of the bidders, funding costs increased by more than 20 basis points, and funding costs vary widely with respect to the country-of-origin. The funding costs we estimate using bidding data are also predictive of market- and accounting-based measures of bank performance, reinforcing the usefulness of ""revealed preference"" information contained in bids.","Nuno Cassola, Ali Hortaçsu and Jakub Kastl",Nuno Cassola,Ali Hortaçsu,Jakub Kastl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

A central problem in the literature is that firm performance is affected by two countervailing ""spillovers"" : a positive effect from technology (knowledge) spillovers and a negative business stealing effects from product market rivals. We develop a general framework incorporating these two types of spillovers and implement this model using measures of a firm's position in technology space and product market space. Using panel data on U.S. firms, we show that technology spillovers quantitatively dominate, so that the gross social returns to R&D are at least twice as high as the private returns. We identify the causal effect of R&D spillovers by using changes in federal and state tax incentives for R&D. We also find that smaller firms generate lower social returns to R&D because they operate more in technological niches. Finally, we detail the desirable properties of an ideal spillover measure and how existing approaches, including our new Mahalanobis measure, compare to these criteria.","Nicholas Bloom, Mark Schankerman and John Van Reenen",Nicholas Bloom,Mark Schankerman,John Van Reenen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Unemployment shocks have a large impact on earnings in the short run, as well as a substantial long-term effect that operates through the wage rate. Shocks associated with job changes and unemployment make a large contribution to the variance of career earnings and operate mostly through the job-specific error components of wages and hours.","Joseph G.

In the problem with a risk-free asset, a risky asset, and an ambiguous asset, we find that portfolio rebalancing in response to higher ambiguity aversion only depends on the ambiguous asset's alpha, setting the performance of the risky asset as benchmark. In particular, a positive alpha corresponds to a long position in the ambiguous asset, a negative alpha corresponds to a short position in the ambiguous asset, and greater ambiguity aversion reduces optimal exposure to ambiguity.

Our estimates imply that these two features combine to generate an empirically important mechanism that amplifies and propagates macroeconomic fluctuations through the joint dynamics of land prices and business investment.","Zheng Liu, Pengfei Wang and Tao Zha",Zheng Liu,Pengfei Wang,Tao Zha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

A moment restriction model is semiparametric and distribution-free; therefore it imposes mild assumptions. Yet it is reasonable to expect that the probability law of observations may have some deviations from the ideal distribution being modeled, due to various factors such as measurement errors. It is then sensible to seek an estimation procedure that is robust against slight perturbation in the probability measure that generates observations. This paper considers local deviations within shrinking topological neighborhoods to develop its large sample theory, so that both bias and variance matter asymptotically. The main result shows that there exists a computationally convenient estimator that achieves optimal minimax robust properties. It is semiparametrically efficient when the model assumption holds, and, at the same time, it enjoys desirable robust properties when it does not.","Yuichi Kitamura, Taisuke Otsu and Kirill Evdokimov",Yuichi Kitamura,Taisuke Otsu,Kirill Evdokimov,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We show that information is aggregated for any voting rule if, for a randomly chosen voter, the probability of switching in favor of one alternative is strictly greater than the probability of switching away from that alternative for any given change in belief over states. If the preference distribution violates this condition, there exist equilibria that produce outcomes different from the full information outcome with high probability for large classes of voting rules.

Applying our methods to much studied U.S. Forest Service timber auctions, we find evidence of correlation among values after controlling for a rich vector of relevant auction covariates; this correlation causes expected profit, the profit-maximizing reserve price, and bidder surplus to be substantially lower than conventional (IPV) analysis of the data would suggest.","Andrés Aradillas-López, Amit Gandhi and Daniel Quint",Andrés Aradillas-López,Amit Gandhi,Daniel Quint,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

This paper gives identification and estimation results for nonseparable models under time-homogeneity conditions that are like ""time is randomly assigned"" or ""time is an instrument."" Partial-identification results for average and quantile effects are given for discrete regressors, under static or dynamic conditions, in fully nonparametric and in semiparametric models, with time effects. It is shown that the usual, linear, fixed-effects estimator is not a consistent estimator of the identified average effect, and a consistent estimator is given. A simple estimator of identified quantile treatment effects is given, providing a solution to the important problem of estimating quantile treatment effects from panel data. Bounds for overall effects in static and dynamic models are given. The dynamic bounds provide a partial-identification solution to the important problem of estimating the effect of state dependence in the presence of unobserved heterogeneity. The impact of T, the number of time periods, is shown by deriving shrinkage rates for the identified set as T grows. We also consider semiparametric, discrete-choice models and find that semiparametric panel bounds can be much tighter than nonparametric bounds. Computationally convenient methods for semiparametric models are presented.

Critical values are obtained using generalized moment selection (GMS) procedures. We show that the proposed CS's have correct uniform asymptotic coverage probabilities. New methods are required to establish these results because an infinite-dimensional nuisance parameter affects the asymptotic distributions.

We show that many bounds characterizations in econometrics, for instance bounds on parameters under conditional moment inequalities, can be formulated as intersection bounds. Our approach is especially convenient for models comprised of a continuum of inequalities that are separable in parameters, and also applies to models with inequalities that are nonseparable in parameters. Since analog estimators for intersection bounds can be severely biased in finite samples, routinely underestimating the size of the identified set, we also offer a medianbias-corrected estimator of such bounds as a by-product of our inferential procedures. We develop theory for large sample inference based on the strong approximation of a sequence of series or kernel-based empirical processes by a sequence of ""penultimate"" Gaussian processes. These penultimate processes are generally not weakly convergent, and thus are non-Donsker. Our theoretical results establish that we can nonetheless perform asymptotically valid inference based on these processes. Our construction also provides new adaptive inequality/moment selection methods. We provide conditions for the use of nonparametric kernel and series estimators, including a novel result that establishes strong approximation for any general series estimator admitting linearization, which may be of independent interest.","Victor Chernozhukov, Sokbae Lee and Adam M.

This paper theoretically evaluates this hypothesis. I assume that optimists have limited wealth and take on leverage so as to take positions in line with their beliefs. To have a significant effect on asset prices, they need to borrow from traders with pessimistic beliefs using loans collateralized by the asset itself. Since pessimists do not value the collateral as much as optimists do, they are reluctant to lend, which provides an endogenous constraint on optimists' ability to borrow and to influence asset prices. I demonstrate that the tightness of this constraint depends on the nature of belief disagreements. Optimism concerning the probability of downside states has no or little effect on asset prices because these types of optimism are disciplined by this constraint. Instead, optimism concerning the relative probability of upside states could have significant effects on asset prices. This asymmetric disciplining effect is robust to allowing for short selling because pessimists that borrow the asset face a similar endogenous constraint. These results emphasize that what investors disagree about matters for asset prices, to a greater extent than the level of disagreements.

Our results apply even when p is much larger than the sample size, n. We show that the IV estimator based on using Lasso or post-Lasso in the first stage is root-n consistent and asymptotically normal when the first stage is approximately sparse, that is, when the conditional expectation of the endogenous variables given the instruments can be well-approximated by a relatively small set of variables whose identities may be unknown. We also show that the estimator is semiparametrically efficient when the structural error is homoscedastic. Notably, our results allow for imperfect model selection, and do not rely upon the unrealistic ""beta-min"" conditions that are widely used to establish validity of inference following model selection (see also Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Hansen (2011b)). In simulation experiments, the Lasso-based IV estimator with a data-driven penalty performs well compared to recently advocated many-instrument robust procedures. In an empirical example dealing with the effect of judicial eminent domain decisions on economic outcomes, the Lasso-based IV estimator outperforms an intuitive benchmark. Optimal instruments are conditional expectations. In developing the IV results, we establish a series of new results for Lasso and post-Lasso estimators of nonparametric conditional expectation functions which are of independent theoretical and practical interest. We construct a modification of Lasso designed to deal with non-Gaussian, heteroscedastic disturbances that uses a data-weighted 𝓁₁-penalty function.

In equilibrium, the speeds of adjustment of mean returns and of capital between the two markets are increasing in the degree to which capital is imbalanced between the two markets, and can be reduced by competition among intermediaries.",Darrell Duffie and Bruno Strulovici,Darrell Duffie,Bruno Strulovici,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

To quantify the economic benefit that dealers derive from this advantage, we study detailed data from Canadian Treasury auctions, where dealers observe customer bids while preparing their own bids. In this setting, dealers can use information on customer bids to learn about (i) competition, that is, the distribution of competing bids in the auction, and (ii) fundamentals, that is, the ex post value of the security being auctioned. We devise formal hypothesis tests for both sources of informational advantage. In our data, we do not find evidence that dealers are learning about fundamentals. We find that the ""information about competition"" contained in customer bids accounts for 13—27% of dealers' expected profits.",Ali Hortaçsu and Jakub Kastl,Ali Hortaçsu,Jakub Kastl,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Two main explanations have been offered: firm selection (larger cities toughen competition, allowing only the most productive to survive) and agglomeration economies (larger cities promote interactions that increase productivity), possibly reinforced by localized natural advantage. To distinguish between them, we nest a generalized version of a tractable firm selection model and a standard model of agglomeration. Stronger selection in larger cities left-truncates the productivity distribution, whereas stronger agglomeration right-shifts and dilates the distribution. Using this prediction, French establishment-level data, and a new quantile approach, we show that firm selection cannot explain spatial productivity differences. This result holds across sectors, city size thresholds, establishment samples, and area definitions.","Pierre-Philippe Combes, Gilles Duranton, Laurent Gobillon, Diego Puga and Sébastien Roux",Pierre-Philippe Combes,Gilles Duranton,Laurent Gobillon,Diego Puga,Sébastien Roux,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

If the security is ""non-separable,"" then there exists a common prior over the states of the world and an equilibrium such that information does not get aggregated.

We give conditions on the parameters such that the process X t is fractional of order d and cofractional of order d — b; that is, there exist vectors β for which βʹX t is fractional of order d — b and no other fractionality order is possible. For b = 1, the model nests the I(d — 1) vector autoregressive model. We define the statistical model by 0 < b ≤ d, but conduct inference when the true values satisfy 0 ≤ d₀ — b₀ < 1/2 and b₀ ≠ 1/2, for which ${{\mathrm{\beta }}^{\prime }}_{0}{\mathrm{X}}_{\mathrm{t}}$ is (asymptotically) a stationary process. Our main technical contribution is the proof of consistency of the maximum likelihood estimators. To this end, we prove weak convergence of the conditional likelihood as a continuous stochastic process in the parameters when errors are independent and identically distributed with suitable moment conditions and initial values are bounded. Because the limit is deterministic, this implies uniform convergence in probability of the conditional likelihood function. If the true value b₀ > 1/2, we prove that the limit distribution of ${\mathrm{T}}^{{\mathrm{b}}_{0}}(\hat{\mathrm{\beta }}-{\mathrm{\beta }}_{0})$ is mixed Gaussian, while for the remaining parameters it is Gaussian.

Existing models have been criticized on the basis that they assume irrationality, that prices are somewhat unresponsive to sales, or that they depend on fragile, knife-edge restrictions. To address these issues, I construct a rational version of Abreu and Brunnermeier (2003), where agents invest growing endowments into an asset, fueling appreciation and eventual overvaluation. Riding bubbles is optimal as long as the growth rate of the bubble and the probability of selling before the crash are high enough.

Our main results provide a characterization of this relationship in terms of the importance of different sectors as suppliers to their immediate customers, as well as their role as indirect suppliers to chains of downstream sectors. Such higher-order interconnections capture the possibility of ""cascade effects"" whereby productivity shocks to a sector propagate not only to its immediate downstream customers, but also to the rest of the economy. Our results highlight that sizable aggregate volatility is obtained from sectoral idiosyncratic shocks only if there exists significant asymmetry in the roles that sectors play as suppliers to others, and that the ""sparseness"" of the input—output matrix is unrelated to the nature of aggregate fluctuations.","Daron Acemoglu, Vasco M.

The outcome of interest varies linearly with a vector of endogenous regressors. The coefficients on these regressors are heterogenous across units and may covary with them. We consider the average partial effect (APE) of a small change in the regressor vector on the outcome (cf. Chamberlain (1984), Wooldridge (2005a)). Chamberlain (1992) calculated the semiparametric efficiency bound for the APE in our model and proposed a √N-consistent estimator. Nonsingularity of the APE's information bound, and hence the appropriateness of Chamberlain's (1992) estimator, requires (i) the time dimension of the panel (T) to strictly exceed the number of random coefficients (p) and (ii) strong conditions on the time series properties of the regressor vector. We demonstrate irregular identification of the APE when T = p and for more persistent regressor processes. Our approach exploits the different identifying content of the subpopulations of stayers—or units whose regressor values change little across periods—and movers—or units whose regressor values change substantially across periods. We propose a feasible estimator based on our identification result and characterize its large sample properties. While irregularity precludes our estimator from attaining parametric rates of convergence, its limiting distribution is normal and inference is straightforward to conduct.

Conditions under which the equilibrium is unique are provided. We analyze welfare and efficiency as they depend on the quality of the news. Higher quality news can lead to more inefficient outcomes. Our model encompasses settings with or without a standard static adverse selection problem—in a dynamic setting with sufficiently informative news, reservation values arise endogenously from the option to sell in the future and the two environments have the same equilibrium structure.",Brendan Daley and Brett Green,Brendan Daley,Brett Green,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We prove that if the intertemporal production function is strictly concave, an equilibrium must converge to a unique steady state in which there is recurrent endogenous risk-taking. (The role played by concavity is clarified by considering a special case in which the production function is instead convex, in which there is no persistent risk-taking.) The steady state is fully characterized. It displays features that are consistent with the stylized facts that individuals both insure downside risk and gamble over upside risk, and it generates similar patterns of risk-taking and avoidance across environments with quite different overall wealth levels. Endogenous risk-taking here is generally Pareto-inefficient. A concern for status thus implies that persistent and inefficient risk-taking hinders the attainment of full equality.",Debraj Ray and Arthur Robson,Debraj Ray,Arthur Robson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The degree of frictions is measured by the utility losses agents tolerate to deviate from the frictionless optimum. The bounds imply that frictions affect intensive margin elasticities much more than extensive margin elasticities. I apply these bounds to the literature on labor supply. The utility costs of ignoring the tax changes used to identify intensive margin labor supply elasticities are typically less than 1% of earnings. As a result, small frictions can explain the differences between micro and macro elasticities, extensive and intensive margin elasticities, and other disparate findings.

This paper characterizes the ""robust predictions"" in static and dynamic games, under arbitrary information structures. This characterization is provided by an extensive form solution concept: interim sequential rationalizability (ISR). In static games, ISR coincides with ICR and does not depend on the assumptions on agents' information. Hence the ""no information"" assumption entails no loss of generality in these settings. This is not the case in dynamic games, where ISR refines ICR and depends on the details of the information structure.

Such models are of substantial interest because they can be deduced from optimal-stopping models with heterogeneous agents that do not naturally produce a mixed proportional hazards structure. We show how strategies for analyzing the identifiability of the mixed proportional hazards model can be adapted to prove identifiability of a hitting-time model with observed covariates and unobserved heterogeneity.

Standard analyses assume voters have a fixed preference ordering over candidates. Coordination problems cannot be overcome in such a case, and it is possible that inferior candidates win. In our setup the majority is also divided as a result of information imperfections. The majority thus faces two problems: aggregating information and coordinating to defeat the minority candidate. We show that when the common value component is strong enough, approval voting produces full information and coordination equivalence: the equilibrium is unique and solves both problems.

This implies that there is a stable coalition structure if agents' preferences are generated by Nash bargaining over coalitional outputs. We further show that all stability-inducing rules for sharing outputs can be represented by a profile of agents' bargaining functions and that agents match assortatively with respect to these bargaining functions.

Under stronger assumptions than those in Kitamura (2001), we establish the following optimality result: (i) empirical likelihood controls the rate at which the probability of a Type I error tends to zero and (ii) among all procedures for which the probability of a Type I error tends to zero at least as fast, empirical likelihood maximizes the rate at which the probability of a Type II error tends to zero for most alternatives.

Extensions of these methods are provided for sequences of functions that are commonly encountered in applications and where the usual methods sometimes fail. Important examples of failure arise in the use of simulation-based estimation methods such as indirect inference. The paper explores the application of these methods to the indirect inference estimator (IIE) in first order autoregressive estimation. The IIE uses a binding function that is sample size dependent. Its limit theory relies on a sequence-based delta method in the stationary case and a sequence-based implicit continuous mapping theorem in unit root and local to unity cases. The new limit theory shows that the IIE achieves much more than (partial) bias correction. It changes the limit theory of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) when the autoregressive coefficient is in the locality of unity, reducing the bias and the variance of the MLE without affecting the limit theory of the MLE in the stationary case. Thus, in spite of the fact that the IIE is a continuously differentiable function of the MLE, the limit distribution of the IIE is not simply a scale multiple of the MLE, but depends implicitly on the full binding function mapping. The unit root case therefore represents an important example of the failure of the delta method and shows the need for an implicit mapping extension of the continuous mapping theorem.",Peter C. B.

To empirically analyze these trends, we estimate a female dynamic labor supply model using an extended version of Eckstein and Wolpin (1989) to compare the various explanations in the literature for the observed trends. This dynamic model provides a much better fit to the life-cycle employment pattern than a static version of the model and a standard static reduced form model (Heckman (1979)). The main finding using the dynamic model is that the rise in education levels accounts for about 33 percent of the increase in female employment, and the rise in wages and narrowing of the gender wage gap account for another 20 percent, while about 40 percent remains unexplained by observed household characteristics. We show that this unexplained portion can be empirically attributed to cohort-specific changes in preferences or the costs of child-rearing and household maintenance.

Examples include static, simultaneous-move finite games of complete and incomplete information in the presence of multiple equilibria; best linear predictors with interval outcome and covariate data; and random utility models of multinomial choice in the presence of interval regressors data. Given a candidate value for 0, we establish that the convex set of moments yielded by the model predictions can be represented as the Aumann expectation of a properly defined random set. The sharp identification region of θ, denoted Θ₁, can then be obtained as the set of minimizers of the distance from a properly specified vector of moments of random variables to this Aumann expectation.

Although the good for sale is divisible, in equilibrium the seller ends up trading her whole endowment or not trading at all. Trades take place at a price equal to the expected quality of the good, conditional on the seller being ready to trade at that price. Our model thus provides a novel strategic foundation for Akerlof's (1970) results.

Supply functions are steeper with higher correlation among the cost parameters. For high (positive) correlation, supply functions are downward sloping, price is above the Cournot level, and as we approach the common value case, price tends to the collusive level. As correlation becomes maximally negative, we approach the competitive outcome. With positive correlation, private information coupled with strategic behavior induces additional distortionary market power above full information levels. Efficiency can be restored with appropriate subsidy schemes or with a precise enough public signal about the common value component. As the market grows large with the number of sellers, the equilibrium becomes price-taking, bid shading is on the order of 1/n, and the order of magnitude of welfare losses is 1/n².

I develop an empirical model that combines a demand system with a production function to generate estimates of productivity. I rely on my framework to identify the productivity effects from reduced trade protection in the Belgian textile market. This trade liberalization provides me with observed demand shifters that are used to separate out the associated price, scale, and productivity effects. Using a matched plant-product level data set and detailed quota data, I find that correcting for unobserved prices leads to substantially lower productivity gains. More specifically, abolishing all quota protections increases firm-level productivity by only 2 percent as opposed to 8 percent when relying on standard measures of productivity. My results beg for a serious réévaluation of a long list of empirical studies that document productivity responses to major industry shocks and, in particular, to opening up to trade.

Conditional on entry, underlying efficiency accounts for much less of the variation in sales in any given market. We use our results to simulate the effects of a 10 percent counterfactual decline in bilateral trade barriers on French firms. While total French sales rise by around $ 16 billion (U.S.), sales by the top decile of firms rise by nearly $23 billion (U.S.). Every lower decile experiences a drop in sales, due to selling less at home or exiting altogether.","Jonathan Eaton, Samuel Kortum and Francis Kramarz",Jonathan Eaton,Samuel Kortum,Francis Kramarz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

A promising place for reliable estimation is rare macroeconomic disasters, which have a major influence on the equity premium. The premium depends on the probability and size distribution of disasters, gauged by proportionate declines in per capita consumption or gross domestic product. Long-term national-accounts data for 36 countries provide a large sample of disasters of magnitude 10% or more. A power-law density provides a good fit to the size distribution, and the upper-tail exponent, α, is estimated to be around 4. A higher α signifies a thinner tail and, therefore, a lower equity premium, whereas a higher coefficient of relative risk aversion, γ, implies a higher premium. The premium is finite if α > γ. The observed premium of 5% generates an estimated γ close to 3, with a 95% confidence interval of 2 to 4. The results are robust to uncertainty about the values of the disaster probability and the equity premium, and can accommodate seemingly paradoxical situations in which the equity premium may appear to be infinite.",Robert J.

In a standard sequential security trading model, subject to sufficient noise trading, people herd if and only if, loosely, their information is sufficiently dispersed so that they consider extreme outcomes more likely than moderate ones. Likewise, people act as contrarians if and only if their information leads them to concentrate on middle values. Both herding and contrarianism generate more volatile prices, and they lower liquidity. They are also resilient phenomena, although by themselves herding trades are self-enforcing whereas contrarian trades are self-defeating.

We show that in this environment, agents typically achieve more insurance than that obtained under self-insurance with a single asset. Consumption allocations exhibit ""excess smoothness,"" as found and defined by Campbell and Deaton (1989). We argue that excess smoothness, in this context, is equivalent to a violation of the intertemporal budget constraint considered in a Bewley economy (with a single asset). We also show parameterizations of our model in which we can obtain a closedform solution for the efficient insurance contract and where the excess smoothness parameter has a structural interpretation in terms of the severity of the moral hazard problem. We present tests of excess smoothness, applied to U.K. microdata and constructed using techniques proposed by Hansen, Roberds, and Sargent (1991) to test the intertemporal budget constraint. Our theoretical model leads us to interpret them as tests of the market structure faced by economic agents. We also construct a test based on the dynamics of the cross-sectional variances of consumption and income that is, in a precise sense, complementary to that based on Hansen, Roberds, and Sargent (1991) and that allows us to estimate the same structural parameter.

We argue that local information transmission generates changes in participation that are geographically heterogeneous, locally correlated, and smooth in the aggregate, just like those observed in our data. In our model, women learn about the effects of maternal employment on children by observing nearby employed women. When few women participate in the labor force, data are scarce and participation rises slowly. As information accumulates in some regions, the effects of maternal employment become less uncertain and more women in that region participate. Learning accelerates, labor force participation rises faster, and regional participation rates diverge. Eventually, information diffuses throughout the economy, beliefs converge to the truth, participation flattens out, and regions become more similar again. To investigate the empirical relevance of our theory, we use a new county-level data set to compare our calibrated model to the time series and geographic patterns of participation.",Alessandra Fogli and Laura Veldkamp,Alessandra Fogli,Laura Veldkamp,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Second, in the data many price changes are temporary. I study an extension of the simple menu-cost model to a multiproduct setting in which firms face economies of scope in adjusting posted and regular prices. The model, because of its ability to replicate this additional set of microeconomic facts, predicts real effects of monetary policy shocks that are much greater than those in Golosov and Lucas and nearly as large as those in the Calvo model.

More specifically, the XMM differs from the GMM in that it can handle not only uniform conditional moment restrictions (i.e., valid for any value of the conditioning variable), but also local conditional moment restrictions valid for a given fixed value of the conditioning variable. The local conditional moment restrictions are of special relevance in derivative pricing to reconstruct the pricing operator on a given day by using the information in a few cross sections of observed traded derivative prices and a time series of underlying asset returns. The estimated derivative prices are consistent for a large time series dimension, but a fixed number of cross sectionally observed derivative prices. The asymptotic properties of the XMM estimator are nonstandard, since the combination of uniform and local conditional moment restrictions induces different rates of convergence (parametric and nonparametric) for the parameters.","P.

The agent privately observes a persistent state variable, typically either income or a taste shock, and he makes reports to the principal. I give verifiable sufficient conditions showing that incentive-compatible contracts can be written recursively, conditioning on the report and two additional state variables: the agent's promised utility and promised marginal utility of the private state. I then study two examples where the optimal contracts can be solved in closed form, showing how persistence alters the nature of the contract. Unlike the previous discretetime models with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) private information, the agent's consumption under the contract may grow over time. Furthermore, in my setting the efficiency losses due to private information increase with the persistence of the private information, and the distortions vanish as I approximate an i.i.d. environment.",Noah Williams,Noah Williams,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

In the base year, a stratified and representative sample of over 40,000 individual income tax filers was selected for the experiment. Half of the tax filers were randomly selected to be thoroughly audited, while the rest were deliberately not audited. The following year, threat-of-audit letters were randomly assigned and sent to tax filers in both groups. We present three main empirical findings. First, using baseline audit data, we find that the tax evasion rate is close to zero for income subject to third-party reporting, but substantial for self-reported income. Since most income is subject to third-party reporting, the overall evasion rate is modest. Second, using quasi-experimental variation created by large kinks in the income tax schedule, we find that marginal tax rates have a positive impact on tax evasion for self-reported income, but that this effect is small in comparison to legal avoidance and behavioral responses. Third, using the randomization of enforcement, we find that prior audits and threat-of-audit letters have significant effects on self-reported income, but no effect on third-party reported income. All these empirical results can be explained by extending the standard model of (rational) tax evasion to allow for the key distinction between self-reported and third-party reported income.","Henrik Jacobsen Kleven, Martin B.

We find that a rich equilibrium dynamics arises when the small players assign positive prior probability to the behavioral type.

In most applications, the function of interest (e. g., an Engel curve or demand function) is assumed to be known up to finitely many parameters (e.g., a linear model), and instrumental variables are used to identify and estimate these parameters. However, linear and other finite-dimensional parametric models make strong assumptions about the population being modeled that are rarely if ever justified by economic theory or other a priori reasoning and can lead to seriously erroneous conclusions if they are incorrect. This paper explores what can be learned when the function of interest is identified through an instrumental variable but is not assumed to be known up to finitely many parameters.

This paper, instead, takes the weak convergence of some function of the data to a limiting random element as the starting point and studies efficiency in the class of tests that remain asymptotically valid for all models that induce the same weak limit. It is found that efficient tests in this class are simply given by efficient tests in the limiting problem— that is, with the limiting random element assumed observed—evaluated at sample analogues. Efficient tests in the limiting problem are usually straightforward to derive, even in nonstandard testing problems. What is more, their evaluation at sample analogues typically yields tests that coincide with suitably robustified versions of optimal tests in canonical parametric versions of the model.

In the program evaluation context, for example, such restrictions are implied by semiparametric models for the potential outcome CEFs given baseline covariates.

We show that coercion and effort are complements, so that coercion increases effort, but coercion always reduces utilitarian social welfare. Better outside options for workers reduce coercion because of the complementarity between coercion and effort: workers with a better outside option exert lower effort in equilibrium and thus are coerced less. Greater demand for labor increases coercion because it increases equilibrium effort. We investigate the interaction between outside options, market prices, and other economic variables by embedding the (coercive) principal-agent relationship in a general equilibrium setup, and studying when and how labor scarcity encourages coercion. General (market) equilibrium interactions working through the price of output lead to a positive relationship between labor scarcity and coercion along the lines of ideas suggested by Domar, while interactions those working through the outside option lead to a negative relationship similar to ideas advanced in neo-Malthusian historical analyses of the decline of feudalism. In net, a decline in available labor increases coercion in general equilibrium if and only if its direct (partial equilibrium) effect is to increase the price of output by more than it increases outside options. Our model also suggests that markets in slaves make slaves worse off, conditional on enslavement, and that coercion is more viable in industries that do not require relationship-specific investment by workers.",Daron Acemoglu and Alexander Wolitzky,Daron Acemoglu,Alexander Wolitzky,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

I examine this hypothesis by estimating a correlated random coefficient model of yields and the corresponding distribution of returns to hybrid maize. This distribution indicates that the group of farmers with the highest estimated gross returns does not use hybrid, but their returns are correlated with high costs of acquiring the technology (due to poor infrastructure). Another group of farmers has lower returns and adopts, while the marginal farmers have zero returns and switch in and out of use over the sample period. Overall, adoption decisions appear to be rational and well explained by (observed and unobserved) variation in heterogeneous net benefits to the technology.",Tavneet Suri,Tavneet Suri,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We conjecture that trade uncertainty is most important for exchange asymmetry. To test this conjecture, we design an experiment where the two treatments impact differently on trade uncertainty, while controlling for choice uncertainty. Supporting our conjecture, we find that ""forcing"" subjects to give away their endowment in a series of exchanges eliminates exchange asymmetry in a subsequent test.

In particular, if it is necessary for (point) identification that the weights take arbitrarily large values, then the parameter of interest, though point identified, cannot be estimated at the regular (parametric) rate and is said to be irregularly identified. This rate depends on relative tail conditions and can be as slow in some examples as $n^{ - (1/4)}$ This nonstandard rate of convergence can lead to numerical instability and/or large standard errors. We examine two weighted model examples: (i) the binary response model under mean restriction introduced by Lewbel (1997) and further generalized to cover endogeneity and selection, where the estimator in this class of models is weighted by the density of a special regressor, and (ii) the treatment effect model under exogenous selection (Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983)), where the resulting estimator of the average treatment effect is one that is weighted by a variant of the propensity score. Without strong relative support conditions, these models, similar to well known ""identified at infinity"" models, lead to estimators that converge at slower than parametric rate, since essentially, to ensure point identification, one requires some variables to take values on sets with arbitrarily small probabilities, or thin sets. For the two models above, we derive some rates of convergence and propose that one conducts inference using rate adaptive procedures that are analogous to Andrews and Schafgans (1998) for the sample selection model.",Shakeeb Khan and Elie Tamer,Shakeeb Khan,Elie Tamer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

However, the characteristics are not contractible, so firms cannot condition their wages on them. This paper shows how to extend arguments from directed search to handle this, allowing for arbitrary distributions of worker and firm types. The model is used to provide a functional relationship that ties together the wage distribution and the wageduration function. This relationship provides a testable implication of the model. This relationship suggests a common property of wage distributions that guarantees that workers who leave unemployment at the highest wages also have the shortest unemployment duration.

Since contemplation is costly, our key axiom, aversion to contingent planning, reflects the individual's preference to learn the menu from which she will be choosing prior to engaging in contemplation about her tastes for the alternatives. Our representation models contemplation strategies as subjective signals over a subjective state space. The subjectivity of the state space and the information structure in our representation makes it difficult to identify them from the preference. To overcome this issue, we show that each signal can be modeled in reduced form as a measure over ex post utility functions without reference to a state space. We show that in this reduced-form representation, the set of measures and their costs are uniquely identified. Finally, we provide a measure of comparative contemplation costs and characterize the special case of our representation where contemplation is costless.",Haluk Ergin and Todd Sarver,Haluk Ergin,Todd Sarver,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We find two major types of individuals: In all three data sets, the choices of roughly 80% of the subjects exhibit significant deviations from linear probability weighting of varying strength, consistent with prospect theory. Twenty percent of the subjects weight probabilities near linearly and behave essentially as expected value maximizers. Moreover, individuals are cleanly assigned to one type with probabilities close to unity.

Although some of these predictions have been met with reasonable success in the field, experimental data have generally not provided results close to the theoretical predictions. In a striking study, Palacios-Huerta and Volij (2008) presented evidence that potentially resolves this puzzle: both amateur and professional soccer players play nearly exact minimax strategies in laboratory experiments. In this paper, we establish important bounds on these results by examining the behavior of four distinct subject pools: college students, bridge professionals, world-class poker players, who have vast experience with high-stakes randomization in card games, and American professional soccer players. In contrast to Palacios-Huerta and Volij's results, we find little evidence that real-world experience transfers to the lab in these games— indeed, similar to previous experimental results, all four subject pools provide choices that are generally not close to minimax predictions. We use two additional pieces of evidence to explore why professionals do not perform well in the lab: (i) complementary experimental treatments that pit professionals against preprogrammed computers and (ii) post-experiment questionnaires. The most likely explanation is that these professionals are unable to transfer their skills at randomization from the familiar context of the field to the unfamiliar context of the lab.","Steven D.

We estimate the elasticity of substitution between investments in one period and stocks of skills in that period to assess the benefits of early investment in children compared to later remediation. We establish nonparametric identification of a general class of production technologies based on nonlinear factor models with endogenous inputs. A by-product of our approach is a framework for evaluating childhood and schooling interventions that does not rely on arbitrarily scaled test scores as outputs and recognizes the differential effects of the same bundle of skills in different tasks. Using the estimated technology, we determine optimal targeting of interventions to children with different parental and personal birth endowments. Substitutability decreases in later stages of the life cycle in the production of cognitive skills. It is roughly constant across stages of the life cycle in the production of noncognitive skills. This finding has important implications for the design of policies that target the disadvantaged. For most configurations of disadvantage it is optimal to invest relatively more in the early stages of childhood than in later stages.","Flavio Cunha, James J. Heckman and Susanne M.

Each voter recognizes that, during experimentation, other voters also learn about their preferences. As a result, pivotal voters today are biased against experimentation because it reduces their likelihood of remaining pivotal. This phenomenon reduces equilibrium experimentation below the socially efficient level, and may even result in a negative option value of experimentation. However, one can restore efficiency by designing a voting rule that depends deterministically on time. Another main result is that even when payoffs of a reform are independently distributed across the population, good news about any individual's payoff increases other individuals' incentives to experiment with that reform, due to a positive voting externality.",Bruno Strulovici,Bruno Strulovici,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Lack of common knowledge leads players to second guess each other's behavior and makes coordination difficult. This restricts the range of equilibria and highlights the role of miscoordination payoffs in determining whether cooperation is sustainable or not.

We relate precision criteria with orderings based on the value of information to a decision maker. We then use precision to study the incentives of an auctioneer to supply private information. Using integral precision, we obtain two results: (i) a more precise signal yields a more efficient allocation; (ii) the auctioneer provides less than the efficient level of information. Supermodular precision allows us to extend the previous analysis to the case in which supplying information is costly and to obtain an additional finding; (iii) there is a complementarity between information and competition, so that both the socially efficient and the auctioneer's optimal choice of precision increase with the number of bidders.",Juan-José Ganuza and José S.

Once detected, however, there has been little attempt to quantify its welfare cost or to assess whether and what potential government interventions may reduce these costs. To do so, we develop a model of annuity contract choice and estimate it using data from the U. K. annuity market. The model allows for private information about mortality risk as well as heterogeneity in preferences over different contract options. We focus on the choice of length of guarantee among individuals who are required to buy annuities. The results suggest that asymmetric information along the guarantee margin reduces welfare relative to a first-best symmetric information benchmark by about £ 127 million per year or about 2 percent of annuitized wealth. We also find that by requiring that individuals choose the longest guarantee period allowed, mandates could achieve the first-best allocation. However, we estimate that other mandated guarantee lengths would have detrimental effects on welfare. Since determining the optimal mandate is empirically difficult, our findings suggest that achieving welfare gains through mandatory social insurance may be harder in practice than simple theory may suggest.","Liran Einav, Amy Finkelstein and Paul Schrimpf",Liran Einav,Amy Finkelstein,Paul Schrimpf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The method consists in sorting or monotone rearranging the original estimated non-monotone curve into a monotone rearranged curve. We show that the rearranged curve is closer to the true quantile curve than the original curve in finite samples, establish a functional delta method for rearrangement-related operators, and derive functional limit theory for the entire rearranged curve and its functionals. We also establish validity of the bootstrap for estimating the limit law of the entire rearranged curve and its functionals. Our limit results are generic in that they apply to every estimator of a monotone function, provided that the estimator satisfies a functional central limit theorem and the function satisfies some smoothness conditions. Consequently, our results apply to estimation of other econometric functions with monotonicity restrictions, such as demand, production, distribution, and structural distribution functions. We illustrate the results with an application to estimation of structural distribution and quantile functions using data on Vietnam veteran status and earnings.","Victor Chernozhukov, Iván Fernández-Val and Alfred Galichon",Victor Chernozhukov,Iván Fernández-Val,Alfred Galichon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We find that the calibrated model with both frictions produces a savings-investment correlation and a volume of capital flows close to the data. To solve the puzzle, the limited enforcement friction needs low default penalties under which capital flows are much lower than those in the data, and the limited spanning friction needs to exogenously restrict capital flows to the observed level.

It is ""subjectively rational"" to choose f rather than g if and only if the minimal expected utility of f (with respect to all priors in the set) is at least as high as that of g.

We find that readers have an economically significant preference for like-minded news.

Firm size can be decreased at no cost or increased subject to adjustment costs. In the optimal contract, investment takes place only if a long enough period of time elapses with no losses occurring. Then, if good performance continues, the agent is paid. As soon as a loss occurs, payments to the agent are suspended, and so is investment if further losses occur. Accumulated bad performance leads to downsizing. We derive explicit formulae for the dynamics of firm size and its asymptotic growth rate, and we provide conditions under which firm size eventually goes to zero or grows without bounds.","Bruno Biais, Thomas Mariotti, Jean-Charles Rochet and Stéphane Villeneuve",Bruno Biais,Thomas Mariotti,Jean-Charles Rochet,Stéphane Villeneuve,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The semiparametric aspect is that the conditional distribution of the random effect, given the predictor variables, is unrestricted. This paper has two results. If the support of the observed predictor variables is bounded, then identification is possible only in the logistic case. Even if the support is unbounded, so that (from Manski (1987)) identification holds quite generally, the information bound is zero unless F is logistic. Hence consistent estimation at the standard pn rate is possible only in the logistic case.",Gary Chamberlain,Gary Chamberlain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Let P denote the distribution of the observed data. The class of models we consider is defined by a population objective function Q(θ, P) for θ ∈ Θ. The point of departure from the classical extremum estimation framework is that it is not assumed that Q(θ, P) has a unique minimizer in the parameter space Θ. The goal may be either to draw inferences about some unknown point in the set of minimizers of the population objective function or to draw inferences about the set of minimizers itself. In this paper, the object of interest is $\Theta _{0}(P)={\rm arg}\ {\rm min}_{\theta \in \Theta }Q(\theta ,P)$ , and so we seek random sets that contain this set with at least some prespecified probability asymptotically. We also consider situations where the object of interest is the image of Θ₀(P) under a known function. Random sets that satisfy the desired coverage property are constructed under weak assumptions. Conditions are provided under which the confidence regions are asymptotically valid not only pointwise in P, but also uniformly in P. We illustrate the use of our methods with an empirical study of the impact of top-coding outcomes on inferences about the parameters of a linear regression.

The model is consistent with some prominent features of asset prices, such as a high equity premium, relatively smooth interest rates, procyclical stock prices, and countercyclical variation in the equity premium, its volatility, and in the Sharpe ratio. In this model, the risk-free asset market plays a central role by allowing non-stockholders (with low EIS) to smooth the fluctuations in their labor income. This process concentrates non-stockholders' labor income risk among a small group of stockholders, who then demand a high premium for bearing the aggregate equity risk. Furthermore, this mechanism is consistent with the very small share of aggregate wealth held by non-stockholders in the U.S. data, which has proved problematic for previous models with limited participation. I show that this large wealth inequality is also important for the model's ability to generate a countercyclical equity premium. When it comes to business cycle performance, the model's progress has been more limited: consumption is still too volatile compared to the data, whereas investment is still too smooth. These are important areas for potential improvement in this framework.",Fatih Guvenen,Fatih Guvenen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

With respect to the empirical literature on entry games originated by Bresnahan and Reiss (1990) and Berry (1992), the main novelty of our framework is to allow for general forms of heterogeneity across players without making equilibrium selection assumptions. We allow the effects that the entry of each individual airline has on the profits of its competitors, its ""competitive effects,"" to differ across airlines. The identified features of the model are sets of parameters (partial identification) such that the choice probabilities predicted by the econometric model are consistent with the empirical choice probabilities estimated from the data. We apply this methodology to investigate the empirical importance of firm heterogeneity as a determinant of market structure in the U.S. airline industry. We find evidence of heterogeneity across airlines in their profit functions. The competitive effects of large airlines (American, Delta, United) are different from those of low cost carriers and Southwest. Also, the competitive effect of an airline is increasing in its airport presence, which is an important measure of observable heterogeneity in the airline industry.

Another feature of our algorithm is that even though the number of grid points on the state variable is small per solution-estimation iteration, the number of effective grid points increases with the number of estimation iterations. This is how we help ease the ""curse of dimensionality."" We simulate and estimate several versions of a simple model of entry and exit to illustrate our methodology.

As in the standard linear cointegrating regression model, the regressor and the dependent variable are jointly dependent and contemporaneously correlated. In nonparametric estimation problems, joint dependence is known to be a major complication that affects identification, induces bias in conventional kernel estimates, and frequently leads to ill-posed inverse problems. In functional cointegrating regressions where the regressor is an integrated or near-integrated time series, it is shown here that inverse and ill-posed inverse problems do not arise. Instead, simple nonparametric kernel estimation of a structural nonparametric cointegrating regression is consistent and the limit distribution theory is mixed normal, giving straightforward asymptotics that are useable in practical work. It is further shown that use of augmented regression, as is common in linear cointegration modeling to address endogeneity, does not lead to bias reduction in nonparametric regression, but there is an asymptotic gain in variance reduction. The results provide a convenient basis for inference in structural nonparametric regression with nonstationary time series when there is a single integrated or near-integrated regressor.

We estimate the presence and importance of hidden information and hidden action problems in a consumer credit market using a new field experiment methodology. We randomized 58,000 direct mail offers to former clients of a major South African lender along three dimensions: (i) an initial ""offer interest rate"" featured on a direct mail solicitation; (ii) a ""contract interest rate"" that was revealed only after a borrower agreed to the initial offer rate; and (ii) a dynamic repayment incentive that was also a surprise and extended preferential pricing on future loans to borrowers who remained in good standing. These three randomizations, combined with complete knowledge of the lender's information set, permit identification of specific types of private information problems. Our setup distinguishes hidden information effects from selection on the offer rate (via unobservable risk and anticipated effort), from hidden action effects (via moral hazard in effort) induced by actual contract terms. We find strong evidence of moral hazard and weaker evidence of hidden information problems. A rough estimate suggests that perhaps 13% to 21% of default is due to moral hazard.

The information gathered is further shared at subsequent meetings, and so on. Equilibria exist in which agents search maximally until they acquire sufficient information precision and then search minimally.

Interestingly, this result is reversed among the Khasi, where women choose the competitive environment more often than Khasi men, and even choose to compete weakly more often than Maasai men. These results provide insights into the underpinnings of the factors hypothesized to be determinants of the observed gender differences in selecting into competitive environments.","Uri Gneezy, Kenneth L.

To evaluate whether the existence of social connections is beneficial to the firm's overall performance, we explore how the effects of social connections vary with the strength of managerial incentives and worker's ability. To do so, we combine panel data on individual worker's productivity from personnel records with a natural field experiment in which we engineered an exogenous change in managerial incentives, from fixed wages to bonuses based on the average productivity of the workers managed. We find that when managers are paid fixed wages, they favor workers to whom they are socially connected irrespective of the worker's ability, but when they are paid performance bonuses, they target their effort toward high ability workers irrespective of whether they are socially connected to them or not. Although social connections increase the performance of connected workers, we find that favoring connected workers is detrimental for the firm's overall performance.","Oriana Bandiera, Iwan Barankay and Imran Rasul",Oriana Bandiera,Iwan Barankay,Imran Rasul,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Second, we establish the nonparametric identification of the bidders' utility function under exclusion restrictions. Our primary exclusion restriction takes the form of an exogenous bidders' participation, leading to a latent distribution of private values that is independent of the number of bidders. The key idea is to exploit the property that the bid distribution varies with the number of bidders while the private value distribution does not. We then extend these results to endogenous bidders' participation when the exclusion restriction takes the form of instruments that do not affect the bidders' private value distribution. Though derived for a benchmark model, our results extend to more general cases such as a binding reserve price, affiliated private values, and asymmetric bidders.

This paper offers a structural framework to analyze the impact of these uncertainty shocks. I build a model with a time-varying second moment, which is numerically solved and estimated using firm-level data. The parameterized model is then used to simulate a macro uncertainty shock, which produces a rapid drop and rebound in aggregate output and employment. This occurs because higher uncertainty causes firms to temporarily pause their investment and hiring. Productivity growth also falls because this pause in activity freezes reallocation across units. In the medium term the increased volatility from the shock induces an overshoot in output, employment, and productivity. Thus, uncertainty shocks generate short sharp recessions and recoveries. This simulated impact of an uncertainty shock is compared to vector autoregression estimations on actual data, showing a good match in both magnitude and timing. The paper also jointly estimates labor and capital adjustment costs (both convex and nonconvex). Ignoring capital adjustment costs is shown to lead to substantial bias, while ignoring labor adjustment costs does not.",Nicholas Bloom,Nicholas Bloom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We also show that the Kleibergen (2005) Lagrange multiplier and conditional likelihood ratio statistics are valid under many weak moments.

The adjustment is itself a function of the act's exposure to distinct sources of ambiguity, as well as its variability. The key elements of the VEU model are a baseline probability and a collection of random variables, or adjustment factors, which represent acts exposed to distinct ambiguity sources and also reflect complementarities among ambiguous events. The adjustment to the baseline expected-utility evaluation of an act is a function of the covariance of its utility profile with each adjustment factor, which reflects exposure to the corresponding ambiguity source.

Using a dynamic panel probit model of female labor supply including heterogeneity and state dependence, he found that adding autoregressive errors led to a substantial diminution in the importance of heterogeneity. This, in turn, meant he could not reject that fertility is exogenous. Here, we extend Hyslop (1999) to allow classification error in employment status, using an estimation procedure developed by Keane and Wolpin (2001) and Keane and Sauer (2005).

We show that such bias-reducing weights will depend on the data in general unless an orthogonal reparameterization or an essentially equivalent condition is available. Two intuitively appealing weighting schemes are discussed. We argue that asymptotically valid confidence intervals can be read from the posterior distribution of the common parameters when N and T grow at the same rate.

Moreover, the bias depends on the Kullback-Leibler distance between the population distribution of the effects and its best approximation in the random effects family.

A striking property is that the equilibrium is block recursive; that is, individuals' optimal decisions and optimal contracts are independent of the distribution of workers. This property makes the equilibrium analysis tractable. Consistent with stylized facts, the equilibrium predicts that (i) wages increase with tenure, (ii) job-to-job transitions decrease with tenure and wages, and (iii) wage mobility is limited in the sense that the lower the worker's wage, the lower the future wage a worker will move to in the next job transition.

The outcome satisfies forward induction if it results from a weakly sequential equilibrium in which players' beliefs assign positive probability only to relevant strategies at each information set reached by a profile of relevant strategies. We prove that if there are two players and payoffs are generic, then an outcome satisfies forward induction if every game with the same reduced normal form after eliminating redundant pure strategies has a sequential equilibrium with an equivalent outcome.

A simple version of the model is an autoregression with a separate intercept for each unit in the cross section, with errors that are independent and identically distributed with a normal distribution. There is a parameter of interest γ and a nuisance parameter τ, a N x K matrix, where N is the cross-section sample size. The focus is on dealing with the incidental parameters problem created by a potentially high-dimension nuisance parameter. We adopt a ""fixed-effects"" approach that seeks to protect against any sequence of incidental parameters. We transform τ to (δ, ρ, ω), where δ is a J x K matrix of coefficients from the least-squares projection of τ on a N x J matrix x of strictly exogenous variables, ρ is a K x K symmetric, positive semidefinite matrix obtained from the residual sums of squares and cross-products in the projection of τ on x, and to is a (N - J) x K matrix whose columns are orthogonal and have unit length. The model is invariant under the actions of a group on the sample space and the parameter space, and we find a maximal invariant statistic. The distribution of the maximal invariant statistic does not depend upon ω. There is a unique invariant distribution for ω. We use this invariant distribution as a prior distribution to obtain an integrated likelihood function. It depends upon the observation only through the maximal invariant statistic. We use the maximal invariant statistic to construct a marginal likelihood function, so we can eliminate ω by integration with respect to the invariant prior distribution or by working with the marginal likelihood function. The two approaches coincide. Decision rules based on the invariant distribution for ω have a minimax property. Given a loss function that does not depend upon ω and given a prior distribution for (γ, δ, ρ), we show how to minimize the average--with respect to the prior distribution for (γ, δ, ρ)--of the maximum risk, where the maximum is with respect to ω. There is a family of prior distributions for (δ, ρ) that leads to a simple closed form for the integrated likelihood function. This integrated likelihood function coincides with the likelihood function for a normal, correlated random-effects model. Under random sampling, the corresponding quasi maximum likelihood estimator is consistent for γ as N → ∞, with a standard limiting distribution. The limit results do not require normality or homoskedasticity (conditional on x) assumptions.",Gary Chamberlain and Marcelo J. Moreira,Gary Chamberlain,Marcelo J.

We derive sufficient conditions for nonparametric identification for various finite mixture models of dynamic discrete choices used in applied work under different assumptions on the Markov property, stationarity, and type-invariance in the transition process. Three elements emerge as the important determinants of identification: the time-dimension of panel data, the number of values the covariates can take, and the heterogeneity of the response of different types to changes in the covariates. For example, in a simple case where the transition function is type-invariant, a time-dimension of T = 3 is sufficient for identification, provided that the number of values the covariates can take is no smaller than the number of types and that the changes in the covariates induce sufficiently heterogeneous variations in the choice probabilities across types. Identification is achieved even when state dependence is present if a model is stationary first-order Markovian and the panel has a moderate time-dimension (T ≥ 6).",Hiroyuki Kasahara and Katsumi Shimotsu,Hiroyuki Kasahara,Katsumi Shimotsu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We represent the semigroup using a positive process with three components: an exponential term constructed from the eigenvalue, a martingale, and a transient eigenfunction term. The eigenvalue encodes the risk adjustment, the martingale alters the probability measure to capture long-run approximation, and the eigenfunction gives the long-run dependence on the Markov state. We discuss sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the relevant eigenvalue and eigenfunction.

Vector calculus methods are used to derive easy-to-check local conditions for our generalization of the CDFC. Finally, we argue that the Jewitt conditions may generalize more flexibly than the CDFC to the multisignal case.

At the same time, there is widely reported public outcry over the impact of these chain stores on other retailers and local communities. This paper develops an empirical model to assess the impact of chain stores on other discount retailers and to quantify the size of the scale economies within a chain. The model has two key features. First, it allows for flexible competition patterns among all players. Second, for chains, it incorporates the scale economies that arise from operating multiple stores in nearby regions. In doing so, the model relaxes the commonly used assumption that entry in different markets is independent. The lattice theory is exploited to solve this complicated entry game among chains and other discount retailers in a large number of markets. It is found that the negative impact of Kmart's presence on Wal-Mart's profit was much stronger in 1988 than in 1997, while the opposite is true for the effect of Wal-Mart's presence on Kmart's profit. Having a chain store in a market makes roughly 50% of the discount stores unprofitable. Wal-Mart's expansion from the late 1980s to the late 1990s explains about 40-50% of the net change in the number of small discount stores and 30-40% for all other discount stores. Scale economies were important for Wal-Mart, but less so for Kmart, and the magnitude did not grow proportionately with the chains' sizes.",Panle Jia,Panle Jia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The great advantage of oblivious equilibria is that they are much easier to compute than are Markov perfect equilibria. Moreover, we show that, as the market becomes large, if the equilibrium distribution of firm states obeys a certain ""light-tail"" condition, then oblivious equilibria closely approximate Markov perfect equilibria.

Using the same framework, we obtain a new formulation of the limiting distribution of the Wald statistic for testing for threshold effects, correcting an expression that appeared in the main theorem presented by Caner and Hansen. Subsequently, we show that under a particular scenario that excludes stationary regressors such as lagged dependent variables and despite the presence of a unit root, this same limiting random variable takes a familiar form that is free of nuisance parameters and already tabulated in the literature, thus removing the need to use bootstrap based inferences. This is a novel and unusual occurrence in this literature on testing for the presence of nonlinear dynamics.",Jean-Yves Pitarakis,Jean-Yves Pitarakis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Households can insure each other through both formal contracts and informal agreements, that is, selfenforcing agreements specifying voluntary transfers. This theoretical setting nests the case of complete markets and the case where only informal agreements are available. We derive a system of nonlinear equations for income and consumption growth. A key prediction of our model is that both variables are affected by lagged consumption as a consequence of the interplay of formal and informal contracting possibilities. In a semi-parametric setting, we prove identification, derive testable restrictions, and estimate the model with the use of data from Pakistani villages. Empirical results are consistent with the economic arguments. Incentive constraints due to self-enforcement bind with positive probability and formal contracts are used to reduce this probability.","Pierre Dubois, Bruno Jullien and Thierry Magnac",Pierre Dubois,Bruno Jullien,Thierry Magnac,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

An SVRV is a mapping that associates a set (rather than a real number) with each element of the sample space. Examples of population features in this class include interval-identified scalar parameters, best linear predictors with interval outcome data, and parameters of semiparametric binary models with interval regressor data. We extend the analogy principle to SVRVs and show that the sample analog estimator of the population identification region is given by a transformation of a Minkowski average of SVRVs. Using the results of the mathematics literature on SVRVs, we show that this estimator converges in probability to the population identification region with respect to the Hausdorff distance. We then show that the Hausdorff distance and the directed Hausdorff distance between the population identification region and the estimator, when properly normalized by $\sqrt n $ , converge in distribution to functions of a Gaussian process whose covariance kernel depends on parameters of the population identification region. We provide consistent bootstrap procedures to approximate these limiting distributions. Using similar arguments as those applied for vector valued random variables, we develop a methodology to test assumptions about the true identification region and its subsets. We show that these results can be used to construct a confidence collection and a directed confidence collection. Those are (respectively) collection of sets that, when specified as a null hypothesis for the true value (a subset of values) of the population identification region, cannot be rejected by our tests.",Arie Beresteanu and Francesca Molinari,Arie Beresteanu,Francesca Molinari,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Young and highly educated subjects have lower aversion for inequity than other groups. Moreover, the model that uses subjective data on expectations generates much better in- and out-of- sample predictions than a model which assumes that players have rational expectations.","Charles Bellemare, Sabine Kröger and Arthur van Soest",Charles Bellemare,Sabine Kröger,Arthur van Soest,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Our result is universal, rather than generic: dynamic completeness of the candidate equilibrium price process and existence of equilibrium follow from the way information is revealed in a Brownian filtration, and from a mild exogenous nondegeneracy condition on the terminal security dividends. The nondegeneracy condition, which requires that finding one point at which a determinant of a Jacobian matrix of dividends is nonzero, is very easy to check.

The essential step in this argument is to express the expectation of one agent's signals, conditional on those of the other agent, in terms of a Markov chain. This allows us to invoke a contraction mapping principle ensuring that if one agent's signals are close to those expected under a particular value of the parameter, then that agent expects the other agent's signals to be even closer to those expected under the parameter value. In contrast, if the agents' observations come from a countably infinite signal space, then this contraction mapping property fails.

The contract is robust in the sense that it does not depend on fine details of the model. The contract gives authority to one party to set the terms of trade and gives the other party a nonexpiring option to trade at these terms. The difference from standard results arises because the initial contract ensures that the renegotiation game has multiple equilibria; the multiplicity of continuation equilibria can be used to enforce efficient investment.",Robert Evans,Robert Evans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Although cost shocks are independent across firms, within a firm costs follow a first-order Markov process. We analyze the set of collusive equilibria available to firms, emphasizing the best collusive scheme for the firms at the start of the game. In general, there is a trade-off between productive efficiency, whereby the low-cost firm serves the market in a given period, and high prices. We show that when costs are perfectly correlated over time within a firm, if the distribution of costs is log-concave and firms are sufficiently patient, then the optimal collusive scheme entails price rigidity: firms set the same price and share the market equally, regardless of their respective costs. When serial correlation of costs is imperfect, partial productive efficiency is optimal. For the case of two cost types, first-best collusion is possible if the firms are patient relative to the persistence of cost shocks, but not otherwise.

This eliminates any meaningful sense in which Nature can randomize.

Estimation of this specification is undertaken using structural, maximum likelihood methods. Our main results based on exponential discounting are robust to alternative specifications such as hyperbolic discounting.

This raises the question as to when the rational types are decisive for aggregate outcomes and when the boundedly rational types shape aggregate results. We examine this question in the context of a long-standing and important economic problem: the adjustment of nominal prices after an anticipated monetary shock. Our experiments suggest that two types of bounded rationality--money illusion and anchoring--are important behavioral forces behind nominal inertia. However, depending on the strategic environment, bounded rationality has vastly different effects on aggregate price adjustment. If agents' actions are strategic substitutes, adjustment to the new equilibrium is extremely quick, whereas under strategic complementarity, adjustment is both very slow and associated with relatively large real effects. This adjustment difference is driven by price expectations, which are very flexible and forward-looking under substitutability but adaptive and sticky under complementarity. Moreover, subjects' expectations are also considerably more rational under substitutability.",Ernst Fehr and Jean-Robert Tyran,Ernst Fehr,Jean-Robert Tyran,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We allow persistent heterogeneity in both capital and total factor productivity alongside low-level investments exempt from adjustment costs to develop the first model consistent with the cross-sectional distribution of establishment investment rates. Examining the implications of lumpy investment for aggregate dynamics in this setting, we find that they remain substantial when factor supply considerations are ignored, but are quantitatively irrelevant in general equilibrium. The substantial implications of general equilibrium extend beyond the dynamics of aggregate series. While the presence of idiosyncratic shocks makes the time-averaged distribution of plant-level investment rates largely invariant to market-clearing movements in real wages and interest rates, we show that the dynamics of plants' investments differ sharply in their presence. Thus, model-based estimations of capital adjustment costs involving panel data may be quite sensitive to the assumption about equilibrium. Our analysis also offers new insights about how nonconvex adjustment costs influence investment at the plant. When establishments face idiosyncratic productivity shocks consistent with existing estimates, we find that nonconvex costs do not cause lumpy investments, but act to eliminate them.",Aubhik Khan and Julia K.

The model explains how, before the 1970s, lower flows into unemployment gave Europe lower unemployment rates than the United States and also how, after 1980, higher durations have kept unemployment rates in Europe persistently higher than in the United States. These outcomes arise from the way Europe's higher firing costs and more generous unemployment compensation make its unemployment rate respond to bigger skill losses among newly displaced workers. Those bigger skill losses also explain why U.S. workers have experienced more earnings volatility since 1980 and why, especially among older workers, hazard rates of gaining employment in Europe now fall sharply with increases in the duration of unemployment.",Lars Ljungqvist and Thomas J.

This notion of utility smoothing can induce a preference for spread: if bad outcomes are concentrated on future periods, moving one of the bad outcomes to today would be beneficial because such an operation eliminates a large loss and replaces it with a small gain.",Katsutoshi Wakai,Katsutoshi Wakai,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We establish a new root mean squared convergence rate for the nonparametric instrumental variable regression when the endogenous regressor could have unbounded support. Root-n asymptotic normality and semiparametric efficiency of the parametric components are also given under a set of ""low-level"" sufficient conditions.

When applied to a micro panel, the decomposition provides flexibility in idiosyncratic behavior over time and across section, while retaining some commonality across the panel by means of an unknown common growth component. This commonality means that when the heterogeneous time varying idiosyncratic components converge over time to a constant, a form of panel convergence holds, analogous to the concept of conditional sigma convergence. The paper provides a framework of asymptotic representations for the factor components that enables the development of econometric procedures of estimation and testing.

Applications of this framework include the analysis of game-theoretic models, revealed preference restrictions, regressions with missing and corrupted data, auction models, structural quantile regressions, and asset pricing models. Specifically, we provide estimators and confidence regions for the set of minimizers $\Theta_I$ of an econometric criterion function $Q(\Theta)$. In applications, the criterion function embodies testable restrictions on economic models. A parameter value Θ that describes an economic model satisfies these restrictions if $Q(\Theta)$ attains its minimum at this value. Interest therefore focuses on the set of minimizers, called the identified set. We use the inversion of the sample analog, $Q_n(\Theta)$, of the population criterion, $Q(\Theta)$, to construct estimators and confidence regions for the identified set, and develop consistency, rates of convergence, and inference results for these estimators and regions. To derive these results, we develop methods for analyzing the asymptotic properties of sample criterion functions under set identification.","Victor Chernozhukov, Han Hong and Elie Tamer",Victor Chernozhukov,Han Hong,Elie Tamer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

First, I show that when the menu of technological possibilities only allows for factor-augmenting technologies, the increase in the supply of a factor induces technological change relatively biased toward that factor-meaning that the induced technological change increases the relative marginal product of the factor becoming more abundant. Moreover, this induced bias can be strong enough to make the relative marginal product of a factor increasing in response to an increase in its supply, thus leading to an upward-sloping relative demand curve. I also show that these results about relative bias do not generalize when more general menus of technological possibilities are considered. Second, I prove that under mild assumptions, the increase in the supply of a factor induces technological change that is absolutely biased toward that factor-meaning that it increases its marginal product at given factor proportions. The third and most important result in the paper establishes the possibility of and conditions for strong absolute equilibrium bias-whereby the price (marginal product) of a factor increases in response to an increase in its supply. I prove that, under some regularity conditions, there will be strong absolute equilibrium bias if and only if the aggregate production function of the economy fails to be jointly concave in factors and technology.

There are two endogenous variables linked by a single structural equation; k of the exogenous variables are excluded from this structural equation and provide the instrumental variables (IV). The reduced-form distribution of the endogenous variables conditional on the exogenous variables corresponds to independent draws from a bivariate normal distribution with linear regression functions and a known covariance matrix. A canonical form of the model has parameter vector (ρ, ϕ, ω), where ϕ is the parameter of interest and is normalized to be a point on the unit circle. The reduced-form coefficients on the instrumental variables are split into a scalar parameter ρ and a parameter vector ω, which is normalized to be a point on the (k-1)-dimensional unit sphere; ρ measures the strength of the association between the endogenous variables and the instrumental variables, and ω is a measure of direction. A prior distribution is introduced for the IV model. The parameters ϕ, ρ, and ω are treated as independent random variables. The distribution for ϕ is uniform on the unit circle; the distribution for ω is uniform on the unit sphere with dimension k-1. These choices arise from the solution of a minimax problem. The prior for ρ is left general. It turns out that given any positive value for ρ, the Bayes estimator of ω does not depend on ρ; it equals the maximum-likelihood estimator. This Bayes estimator has constant risk; because it minimizes average risk with respect to a proper prior, it is minimax. The same general concepts are applied to obtain confidence intervals. The prior distribution is used in two ways. The first way is to integrate out the nuisance parameter ω in the IV model. This gives an integrated likelihood function with two scalar parameters, ϕ and ρ. Inverting a likelihood ratio test, based on the integrated likelihood function, provides a confidence interval for ϕ. This lacks finite sample optimality, but invariance arguments show that the risk function depends only on ρ and not on ϕ or ω. The second approach to confidence sets aims for finite sample optimality by setting up a loss function that trades off coverage against the length of the interval. The automatic uniform priors are used for ϕ, and ω, but a prior is also needed for the scalar ρ, and no guidance is offered on this choice. The Bayes rule is a highest posterior density set. Invariance arguments show that the risk function depends only on ρ and not on ϕ or ω. The optimality result combines average risk and maximum risk. The confidence set minimizes the average-with respect to the prior distribution for ρ-of the maximum risk, where the maximization is with respect to ϕ and ω.",Gary Chamberlain,Gary Chamberlain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

This can alternatively be viewed as an infinitely repeated game wherein players can offer one another enforceable contracts that govern play for the rest of the game. Theory is silent with regard to how the surplus is likely to be split, because a folk theorem applies. Perturbing such a game with a rich set of behavioral types for each player yields a specific asymptotic prediction for how the surplus will be divided, as the perturbation probabilities approach zero. Behavioral types may follow nonstationary strategies and respond to the opponent's play. In equilibrium, rational players initially choose a behavioral type to imitate and a war of attrition ensues. How much should a player try to get and how should she behave while waiting for the resolution of bargaining? In both respects she should build her strategy around the advice given by the ""Nash bargaining with threats"" (NBWT) theory developed for two-stage games. In any perfect Bayesian equilibrium, she can guarantee herself virtually her NBWT payoff by imitating a behavioral type with the following simple strategy: in every period, ask for (and accept nothing less than) that player's NBWT share and, while waiting for the other side to concede, take the action Nash recommends as a threat in his two-stage game. The results suggest that there are forces at work in some dynamic games that favor certain payoffs over all others.

First, multiplicity may obtain under the same conditions on exogenous information that guarantee uniqueness in the static benchmark. Second, fundamentals may predict the eventual fate of the regime but not the timing or the number of attacks.

We develop a dynamic structural model of export supply that characterizes these two decisions. The model embodies plant-level heterogeneity in export profits, uncertainty about the determinants of future profits, and market entry costs for new exporters. Using a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov chain estimator, we fit this model to plant-level panel data on three Colombian manufacturing industries. We obtain profit function and sunk entry cost coefficients, and use them to simulate export responses to shifts in the exchange-rate process and several types of export subsidies. In each case, the aggregate export response depends on entry costs, expectations about the exchange rate process, prior exporting experience, and producer heterogeneity. Export revenue subsidies are far more effective at stimulating exports than policies that subsidize entry costs.","Sanghamitra Das, Mark J. Roberts and James R. Tybout",Sanghamitra Das,Mark J.

Economic models often have many rationalizable outcomes, motivating economists to use refinements of rationalizability, including equilibrium refinements. In this paper we try to achieve a general understanding of when this multiplicity occurs and how one should deal with it. Assuming that the set of possible payoff functions and belief structures is sufficiently rich, we establish a revealing structure of the correspondence of beliefs to sets of rationalizable outcomes. We show that, for any rationalizable action a of any type, we can perturb the beliefs of the type in such a way that a is uniquely rationalizable for the new type. This unique outcome will be robust to further small changes. When multiplicity occurs, then we are in a ""knife-edge"" case, where the unique rationalizable outcome changes, sandwiched between open sets of types where each of the rationalizable actions is uniquely rationalizable. As an immediate application of this result, we characterize, for any refinement of rationalizability, the predictions that are robust to small misspecifications of interim beliefs.

We consider this general methodological question in the context of eliciting risk attitudes. The controls that are typically employed in laboratory settings, such as the use of abstract lotteries, could lead subjects to employ behavioral rules that differ from the ones they employ in the field. Because it is field behavior that we are interested in understanding, those controls might be a confound in themselves if they result in differences in behavior. We find that the use of artificial monetary prizes provides a reliable measure of risk attitudes when the natural counterpart outcome has minimal uncertainty, but that it can provide an unreliable measure when the natural counterpart outcome has background risk. Behavior tended to be moderately risk averse when artificial monetary prizes were used or when there was minimal uncertainty in the natural nonmonetary outcome, but subjects drawn from the same population were much more risk averse when their attitudes were elicited using the natural nonmonetary outcome that had some background risk. These results are consistent with conventional expected utility theory for the effects of background risk on attitudes to risk.","Glenn W. Harrison, John A. List and Charles Towe",Glenn W.

Two main econometric issues appear in the estimation of these models: the indeterminacy problem associated with the existence of multiple equilibria and the computational burden in the solution of the game. We propose a class of pseudo maximum likelihood (PML) estimators that deals with these problems, and we study the asymptotic and finite sample properties of several estimators in this class. We first focus on two-step PML estimators, which, although they are attractive for their computational simplicity, have some important limitations: they are seriously biased in small samples; they require consistent nonparametric estimators of players' choice probabilities in the first step, which are not always available; and they are asymptotically inefficient. Second, we show that a recursive extension of the two-step PML, which we call nested pseudo likelihood (NPL), addresses those drawbacks at a relatively small additional computational cost. The NPL estimator is particularly useful in applications where consistent nonparametric estimates of choice probabilities either are not available or are very imprecise, e.g., models with permanent unobserved heterogeneity.

Instead, the identification results for the marginal quantiles lead to an estimation procedure for the quantile treatment effect parameters that has two steps: nonparametric estimation of the propensity score and computation of the difference between the solutions of two separate minimization problems. Root-N consistency, asymptotic normality, and achievement of the semiparametric efficiency bound are shown for that estimator. A consistent estimation procedure for the variance is also presented. Finally, the method developed here is applied to evaluation of a job training program and to a Monte Carlo exercise. Results from the empirical application indicate that the method works relatively well even for a data set with limited overlap between treated and controls in the support of covariates.

(ii) We accommodate conditional evaluation objectives (can we predict which forecast will be more accurate at a future date?), which nest unconditional objectives (which forecast was more accurate on average?), that have been the sole focus of previous literature. As a result of (i), our tests have several advantages: they capture the effect of estimation uncertainty on relative forecast performance, they can handle forecasts based on both nested and nonnested models, they allow the forecasts to be produced by general estimation methods, and they are easy to compute. Although both unconditional and conditional approaches are informative, conditioning can help fine-tune the forecast selection to current economic conditions. To this end, we propose a two-step decision rule that uses current information to select the best forecast for the future date of interest.

Since the causes that underlie cancer and cardiovascular disease are likely dependent, the decline in mortality rates from cardiovascular disease may partially explain the lack of progress in cancer mortality. Because competing risks models (used to model mortality from multiple causes) are fundamentally unidentified, it is difficult to estimate cancer trends. We derive bounds for aspects of the underlying distributions without assuming that the underlying risks are independent. We then estimate changes in cancer and cardiovascular mortality since 1970.

Nonetheless, we find little evidence that winning a lottery provides any systematic benefit across a wide variety of traditional academic measures. Lottery winners do, however, experience improvements on a subset of nontraditional outcome measures, such as self-reported disciplinary incidents and arrest rates.","Julie Berry Cullen, Brian A.

Much of this work begins with pooled estimation of the model(s) under scrutiny.

This occurs when comparisons are based on goodness of fit and when comparisons are based on the relative importance of the two kinds of learning in hybrid structural models.

Still, we show that a greedy algorithm finds the optimal set, finding first the best singleton, then the best single addition to it, and so on.

This Bonacich-Nash linkage implies that aggregate equilibrium increases with network size and density. We then analyze a policy that consists of targeting the key player, that is, the player who, once removed, leads to the optimal change in aggregate activity.

The unobserved factors and the individual-specific errors are allowed to follow arbitrary stationary processes, and the number of unobserved factors need not be estimated. The basic idea is to filter the individual-specific regressors by means of cross-section averages such that asymptotically as the cross-section dimension (N) tends to infinity, the differential effects of unobserved common factors are eliminated. The estimation procedure has the advantage that it can be computed by least squares applied to auxiliary regressions where the observed regressors are augmented with cross-sectional averages of the dependent variable and the individual-specific regressors. A number of estimators (referred to as common correlated effects (CCE) estimators) are proposed and their asymptotic distributions are derived. The small sample properties of mean group and pooled CCE estimators are investigated by Monte Carlo experiments, showing that the CCE estimators have satisfactory small sample properties even under a substantial degree of heterogeneity and dynamics, and for relatively small values of N and T.",M.

In other words, deterministic ex post implementation requires that the same alternative must be chosen irrespective of agents' signals. The proof shows that ex post implementability of a nontrivial deterministic social choice function implies that certain rates of information substitution coincide for all agents.

There are three essential determinants of wages in our model: productivity, competition between employers resulting from on-the-job search, and the workers' bargaining power. We find that between-firm competition matters a lot in the determination of wages, because it is quantitatively more important than wage bargaining à la Nash in raising wages above the workers' ""reservation wages,"" defined as out-of-work income. In particular, we detect no significant bargaining power for intermediate- and low-skilled workers, and a modestly positive bargaining power for high-skilled workers.","Pierre Cahuc, Fabien Postel-Vinay and Jean-Marc Robin",Pierre Cahuc,Fabien Postel-Vinay,Jean-Marc Robin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The paper presents a test of the hypothesis that g belongs to a finite-dimensional parametric family against a nonparametric alternative. The test does not require nonparametric estimation of g and is not subject to the ill-posed inverse problem of nonparametric instrumental variables estimation. Under mild conditions, the test is consistent against any alternative model. In large samples, its power is arbitrarily close to 1 uniformly over a class of alternatives whose distance from the null hypothesis is O(n-1/2), where n is the sample size. In Monte Carlo simulations, the finite-sample power of the new test exceeds that of existing tests.",Joel L. Horowitz,Joel L. Horowitz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

An attractive feature of OLS is that it gives the minimum mean-squared error linear approximation to the conditional expectation function even when the linear model is misspecified. Empirical research using quantile regression with discrete covariates suggests that QR may have a similar property, but the exact nature of the linear approximation has remained elusive. In this paper, we show that QR minimizes a weighted mean-squared error loss function for specification error. The weighting function is an average density of the dependent variable near the true conditional quantile. The weighted least squares interpretation of QR is used to derive an omitted variables bias formula and a partial quantile regression concept, similar to the relationship between partial regression and OLS. We also present asymptotic theory for the QR process under misspecification of the conditional quantile function. The approximation properties of QR are illustrated using wage data from the U.S. census.

However, over this time, the real hourly wage in the service sector grew only slightly faster than in the goods sector. In this paper, we assess whether or not the essential constancy of the relative wage implies that individuals face small costs of switching sectors, and we quantify the relative importance of labor supply and demand factors in the growth of the service sector. We specify and estimate a two-sector labor market equilibrium model that allows us to address these empirical issues in a unified framework. Our estimates imply that there are large mobility costs: output in both sectors would have been double their current levels if these mobility costs had been zero. In addition, we find that demand-side factors, that is, technological change and movements in product and capital prices, were responsible for the growth of the service sector.",Donghoon Lee and Kenneth I.

What are the consequences for inference of the use of approximated likelihoods? First, we find conditions under which, as the approximated policy function converges to the exact policy, the approximated likelihood also converges to the exact likelihood. Second, we show that second order approximation errors in the policy function, which almost always are ignored by researchers, have first order effects on the likelihood function. Third, we discuss convergence of Bayesian and classical estimates.

When the ambient family of priors is convex, generic priors do not allow for full surplus extraction provided that for at least one prior in this family, players' beliefs about other players' types do not pin down the players' own preferences.

The subsidy was available for 3 years, but only to people who began working full time within 12 months of random assignment. A simple optimizing model suggests that the eligibility rules created an ""establishment"" incentive to find a job and leave welfare within a year of random assignment, and an ""entitlement"" incentive to choose work over welfare once eligibility was established. Building on this insight, we develop an econometric model of welfare participation that allows us to separate the two effects and estimate the impact of the earnings subsidy on welfare entry and exit rates among those who achieved eligibility. The combination of the two incentives explains the time profile of the experimental impacts, which peaked 15 months after random assignment and faded relatively quickly. Our findings suggest that about half of the peak impact of SSP was attributable to the establishment incentive.

A key feature of our model is that it achieves a separation between ambiguity, identified as a characteristic of the decision maker's subjective beliefs, and ambiguity attitude, a characteristic of the decision maker's tastes. We show that attitudes toward pure risk are characterized by the shape of u, as usual, while attitudes toward ambiguity are characterized by the shape of φ. Ambiguity itself is defined behaviorally and is shown to be characterized by properties of the subjective set of measures Π. One advantage of this model is that the well-developed machinery for dealing with risk attitudes can be applied as well to ambiguity attitudes. The model is also distinct from many in the literature on ambiguity in that it allows smooth, rather than kinked, indifference curves. This leads to different behavior and improved tractability, while still sharing the main features (e.g., Ellsberg's paradox). The maxmin expected utility model (e.g., Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989)) with a given set of measures may be seen as a limiting case of our model with infinite ambiguity aversion.

However, spiteful punishment vanishes if the punishers can no longer affect the payoff differences between themselves and the punished individual, whereas the cooperators even increase the resources devoted to punishment in this case. Our data also discriminate between different fairness principles. Fairness theories that are based on the assumption that players compare their own payoff to the group's average or the group's total payoff cannot explain the fact that cooperators target their punishment at the defectors. Fairness theories that assume that players aim to minimize payoff inequalities cannot explain the fact that cooperators punish defectors even if payoff inequalities cannot be reduced. Therefore, retaliation, i.e., the desire to harm those who committed unfair acts, seems to be the most important motive behind fairness-driven informal sanctions.","Armin Falk, Ernst Fehr and Urs Fischbacher",Armin Falk,Ernst Fehr,Urs Fischbacher,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Well designed rules trade off society's desire to give the monetary authority discretion to react to its private information against society's need to prevent that authority from giving in to the temptation to stimulate the economy with unexpected inflation, the time inconsistency problem. Although this dynamic mechanism design problem seems complex, its solution is simple: legislate an inflation cap. The optimal degree of monetary policy discretion turns out to shrink as the severity of the time inconsistency problem increases relative to the importance of private information.

The probability limits of the LS estimators are determined, and necessary and sufficient conditions are given for consistency. The asymptotic distributions of the estimators are found to be mixed normal after recentering and scaling. The t, Wald, and F statistics are found to have asymptotic standard normal, χ 2, and scaled χ 2 distributions, respectively, under the null hypothesis when the conditions required for consistency of the parameter under test hold. However, the absolute values of t, Wald, and F statistics are found to diverge to infinity under the null hypothesis when these conditions fail. Confidence intervals exhibit similarly dichotomous behavior. Hence, common shocks are found to be innocuous in some circumstances, but quite problematic in others. Models with factor structures for errors and regressors are considered. Using the general results, conditions are determined under which consistency of the LS estimators holds and fails in models with factor structures.

We show that consistent estimation depends importantly on the strength of the instruments as measured by rn, the rate of growth of the so-called concentration parameter, and also on Kn. In particular, when Kn → ∞, the concentration parameter can grow, even if each individual instrument is only weakly correlated with the endogenous explanatory variables, and consistency of certain estimators can be established under weaker conditions than have previously been assumed in the literature. Hence, the use of many weak instruments may actually improve the performance of certain point estimators. More specifically, we find that the limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) estimator and the bias-corrected two-stage least squares (B2SLS) estimator are consistent when $\sqrt{K_{n}}/r_{n}$ → 0, while the two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimator is consistent only if $K_{n}/r_{n}$ → 0 as n → ∞.

Its asymptotic χ 2 distribution therefore holds under a wider set of circumstances, like weak instruments, than the standard full rank case for the expected Jacobian under which the asymptotic χ 2 distributions of the traditional statistics are valid. The behavior of the K statistic can be spurious around inflection points and maxima of the objective function. This inadequacy is overcome by combining the K statistic with a statistic that tests the validity of the moment equations and by an extension of Moreira's (2003) conditional likelihood ratio statistic toward GMM.

Unlike previous models, we allow drugs to have distinct symptomatic and curative effects, and endogenize treatment length by allowing drug choices to affect patients' underlying probability of recovery. We find that drugs' rankings along these dimensions differ, with high symptomatic effects for drugs with the highest market shares and high curative effects for drugs with the greatest medical efficacy.

We give a simple example to illustrate that approximate equilibria might be very far from exact equilibria. We then interpret approximate equilibria as equilibria for close-by economies; that is, for economies with close-by individual endowments and preferences. We present an error analysis for two models that are commonly used in applications, an overlapping generations (OLG) model with stochastic production and an asset pricing model with infinitely lived agents.

Under our general model the logarithms of the squared returns can be decomposed into the sum of a long-memory signal and a white noise. We consider periodogram-based estimators using a local Whittle criterion function. We allow the optional inclusion of an additional term to account for possible correlation between the signal and noise processes, as would occur in the FIEGARCH model. We also allow for potential nonstationarity in volatility by allowing the signal process to have a memory parameter $d^{\ast}\geq 1/2$. We show that the local Whittle estimator is consistent for $d^{\ast}\in (0,1)$. We also show that the local Whittle estimator is asymptotically normal for $d^{\ast}\in (0,3/4)$ and essentially recovers the optimal semiparametric rate of convergence for this problem. In particular, if the spectral density of the short-memory component of the signal is sufficiently smooth, a convergence rate of $n^{2/5-\delta}$ for $d^{\ast}\in (0,3/4)$ can be attained, where n is the sample size and δ > 0 is arbitrarily small. This represents a strong improvement over the performance of existing semiparametric estimators of persistence in volatility. We also prove that the standard Gaussian semiparametric estimator is asymptotically normal if $d^{\ast}=0$. This yields a test for long memory in volatility.","Clifford M.

This problem may in principle be overcome by using projection methods (Dufour (1997), Dufour and Jasiak (2001)).

We use this theory to derive the limiting distribution of Granger and Lin's (1994) normalized entropy measure of serial dependence, which was previously not available in the literature.

Our test is useful in, for example, testing the random walk hypothesis, evaluating density forecasts, and identifying important lags of a time series.

In fact, under mild conditions, a feasible allocation is second best optimal if and only if the associated taxes are lower than the Laffer bound. The only restriction that efficiency puts on the shape of the tax scheme is this upper Laffer bound. The Laffer tax scheme itself can be computed from the joint distribution of the agents' productivities and work opportunity costs. Depending on the economy, it can take widely different forms, and exhibit, for instance, negative marginal tax rates.

Without completeness, individual decision making depends on a set of probability distributions over the state space. A bundle is preferred to another if and only if it has larger expected utility for all probabilities in this set. When preferences are complete this set is a singleton, and the model reduces to standard expected utility. In this setting, we characterize Pareto optima and equilibria, and show that the presence of uncertainty generates robust indeterminacies in equilibrium prices and allocations for any specification of initial endowments. We derive comparative statics results linking the degree of uncertainty with changes in equilibria. Despite the presence of robust indeterminacies, we show that equilibrium prices and allocations vary continuously with underlying fundamentals. Equilibria in a standard risk economy are thus robust to adding small degrees of uncertainty. Finally, we give conditions under which some assets are not traded due to uncertainty aversion.",Luca Rigotti and Chris Shannon,Luca Rigotti,Chris Shannon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

However, in observational studies, the variables of interest (e.g., education, prices) are often endogenous, making conventional quantile regression inconsistent and hence inappropriate for recovering the causal effects of these variables on the quantiles of economic outcomes. In order to address this problem, we develop a model of quantile treatment effects (QTE) in the presence of endogeneity and obtain conditions for identification of the QTE without functional form assumptions. The principal feature of the model is the imposition of conditions that restrict the evolution of ranks across treatment states. This feature allows us to overcome the endogeneity problem and recover the true QTE through the use of instrumental variables. The proposed model can also be equivalently viewed as a structural simultaneous equation model with nonadditive errors, where QTE can be interpreted as the structural quantile effects (SQE).",Victor Chernozhukov and Christian Hansen,Victor Chernozhukov,Christian Hansen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Our framework generalizes previous studies restricted to unit root integrated processes and permits simultaneous analysis of spurious and cointegrated NFI vectors. We propose a modified F-statistic, based on a particular studentization, which converges weakly under both hypotheses, despite the fact that OLS estimates are only consistent under cointegration. This statistic leads to a Wald-type test of cointegration when combined with a narrow band GLS-type estimate. Our semiparametric methodology allows consistent testing of the spurious regression hypothesis against the alternative of fractional cointegration without prior knowledge on the memory of the original series, their short run properties, the cointegrating vector, or the degree of cointegration. This semiparametric aspect of the modelization does not lead to an asymptotic loss of power, permitting the Wald statistic to diverge faster under the alternative of cointegration than when testing for a hypothesized cointegration vector. In our simulations we show that the method has comparable power to customary procedures under the unit root cointegration setup, and maintains good properties in a general framework where other methods may fail.

For this case confidence intervals (CIs) have been proposed that cover the entire identification region with fixed probability. Here, we introduce a conceptually different type of confidence interval. Rather than cover the entire identification region with fixed probability, we propose CIs that asymptotically cover the true value of the parameter with this probability. However, the exact coverage probabilities of the simplest version of our new CIs do not converge to their nominal values uniformly across different values for the width of the identification region. To avoid the problems associated with this, we modify the proposed CI to ensure that its exact coverage probabilities do converge uniformly to their nominal values.

By extending a result of Chamberlain, it is shown that root-n consistent regular estimators can be constructed in panel binary models if and only if the property of sufficiency holds.

It would be better to measure expectations in the form called for by modern economic theory; that is, subjective probabilities.

This new probability measure puts zero probability on paths where default occurs prior to the maturity, and is thus only absolutely continuous with respect to the risk-neutral probability measure.

As a spatially adaptive analytic tool, wavelets are useful for capturing serial correlation where the spectrum has peaks or kinks, as can arise from persistent dependence, seasonality, and other kinds of periodicity. This paper proposes a new class of generally applicable wavelet-based tests for serial correlation of unknown form in the estimated residuals of a panel regression model, where error components can be one-way or two-way, individual and time effects can be fixed or random, and regressors may contain lagged dependent variables or deterministic/stochastic trending variables. Our tests are applicable to unbalanced heterogenous panel data. They have a convenient null limit N(0,1) distribution. No formulation of an alternative model is required, and our tests are consistent against serial correlation of unknown form even in the presence of substantial inhomogeneity in serial correlation across individuals. This is in contrast to existing serial correlation tests for panel models, which ignore inhomogeneity in serial correlation across individuals by assuming a common alternative, and thus have no power against the alternatives where the average of serial correlations among individuals is close to zero. We propose and justify a data-driven method to choose the smoothing parameter--the finest scale in wavelet spectral estimation, making the tests completely operational in practice. The data-driven finest scale automatically converges to zero under the null hypothesis of no serial correlation and diverges to infinity as the sample size increases under the alternative, ensuring the consistency of our tests.

A distinctive feature of PANIC is that it tests the unobserved components of the data instead of the observed series. The key to PANIC is consistent estimation of the space spanned by the unobserved common factors and the idiosyncratic errors without knowing a priori whether these are stationary or integrated processes. We provide a rigorous theory for estimation and inference and show that the tests have good finite sample properties.",Jushan Bai and Serena Ng,Jushan Bai,Serena Ng,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

This paper studies minimax-regret treatment choice using the sample data generated by a classical randomized experiment. Consider a utilitarian social planner who must choose among the feasible statistical treatment rules, these being functions that map the sample data and observed covariates of population members into a treatment allocation. If the planner knew the population distribution of treatment response, the optimal treatment rule would maximize mean welfare conditional on all observed covariates. The appropriate use of covariate information is a more subtle matter when only sample data on treatment response are available. I consider the class of conditional empirical success rules; that is, rules assigning persons to treatments that yield the best experimental outcomes conditional on alternative subsets of the observed covariates. I derive a closed-form bound on the maximum regret of any such rule. Comparison of the bounds for rules that condition on smaller and larger subsets of the covariates yields sufficient sample sizes for productive use of covariate information. When the available sample size exceeds the sufficiency boundary, a planner can be certain that conditioning treatment choice on more covariates is preferable (in terms of minimax regret) to conditioning on fewer covariates.",Charles F.

Low effort or bad quality is penalized by the termination of the relationship, wielding a powerful effect on contract enforcement. Successful long-term relations exhibit generous rent sharing and high effort (quality) from the very beginning of the relationship. In the absence of third-party enforcement, markets resemble a collection of bilateral trading islands rather than a competitive market. If contracts are third party enforceable, rent sharing and long-term relations are absent and the vast majority of trades are initiated with public offers.

An integration of financial markets affects the set of stable steady states, as it changes the balance between the equalizing force of the diminishing returns technology and the unequalizing force of the wealth-dependent borrowing constraint. The model is tractable enough to allow for a complete characterization of the stable steady states. In the absence of the international financial market, the world economy has a unique steady state, which is symmetric and stable. In the presence of the international financial market, symmetry-breaking occurs under some conditions. That is, the symmetric steady state loses its stability and stable asymmetric steady states come to exist. In the stable asymmetric steady states, the world economy is endogenously divided into the rich and poor countries; the borrowing constraints are binding in the poor but not in the rich; the world output is smaller, the rich are richer and the poor are poorer in any of the stable asymmetric steady states than in the (unstable) symmetric steady state.",Kiminori Matsuyama,Kiminori Matsuyama,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

In addition we discuss an interpretation of series and sieve estimators as idempotent transformations of the empirical distribution that helps explain the known result that they lead to the SBP.

This is similar to the Glosten-Milgrom (1985) model, except that we allow the informed trader to optimize his times of trading. We show there is an equilibrium in the Glosten-Milgrom-type model in which the informed trader plays a mixed strategy (a point process with stochastic intensity).

The two moment conditions in the GMM approach are obtained by constructing bias corrections to the score functions under OLS and GLS detrending, respectively. It is shown that the moment condition under GLS detrending corresponds to taking the projected score on the Bhattacharya basis, linking the approach to recent work on projected score methods for models with infinite numbers of nuisance parameters (Waterman and Lindsay (1998)). Assuming that the localizing parameter takes a nonpositive value, we establish consistency of the GMM estimator and find its limiting distribution. A notable new finding is that the GMM estimator has convergence rate n<sup>1/6</sup>, slower than √n, when the true localizing parameter is zero (i.e., when there is a panel unit root) and the deterministic trends in the panel are linear.

This paper pits neoclassical theory against prospect theory by investigating data drawn from more than 375 subjects actively participating in a well-functioning marketplace. The pattern of results suggests that prospect theory adequately organizes behavior among inexperienced consumers, but consumers with intense market experience behave largely in accordance with neoclassical predictions. Moreover, the data are consistent with the notion that consumers learn to overcome the endowment effect in situations beyond specific problems they have previously encountered.

While a root n consistent estimator has been derived for polynomial specifications (see Hausman, Ichimura, Newey, and Powell (1991)), such an estimator for general nonlinear specifications has so far not been available. Using the additional information provided by the repeated observation, the suggested estimator separates the measurement error from the ""true"" value of the regressors thanks to a useful property of the Fourier transform: The Fourier transform converts the integral equations that relate the distribution of the unobserved ""true"" variables to the observed variables measured with error into algebraic equations. The solution to these equations yields enough information to identify arbitrary moments of the ""true,"" unobserved variables. The value of these moments can then be used to construct any estimator that can be written in terms of moments, including traditional linear and nonlinear least squares estimators, or general extremum estimators. The proposed estimator is shown to admit a representation in terms of an influence function, thus establishing its root n consistency and asymptotic normality.

We show that when the risk in the valuations increases, DARA bidders will reduce their bids by more than the appropriate increase in the risk premium. Ceteris paribus, buyers will be better off bidding for a more risky object in first price, second price, and English auctions with affiliated common (interdependent) values. This ""precautionary bidding"" effect arises because the expected marginal utility of income increases with risk, so buyers are reluctant to bid so highly. We also show that precautionary bidding behavior can make DARA bidders prefer bidding in a common values setting to bidding in a private values one when risk-neutral or CARA bidders would be indifferent. Thus the potential for a ""winner's curse"" can be a blessing for rational DARA bidders.",Péter Eső and Lucy White,Péter Eső,Lucy White,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We evaluate a Kenyan project in which school-based mass treatment with deworming drugs was randomly phased into schools, rather than to individuals, allowing estimation of overall program effects. The program reduced school absenteeism in treatment schools by one-quarter, and was far cheaper than alternative ways of boosting school participation. Deworming substantially improved health and school participation among untreated children in both treatment schools and neighboring schools, and these externalities are large enough to justify fully subsidizing treatment.

Our motivation comes from the recent literature on the poor properties of standard instrumental variables estimators when the instrumental variables are weakly correlated with the endogenous regressor. Our proposed estimator puts a random coefficients structure on the relation between the endogenous regressor and the instruments. The variance of the random coefficients is modelled as an unknown parameter. In addition to proposing a new estimator, our analysis yields new insights into the properties of the standard two-stage least squares (TSLS) and limited-information maximum likelihood (LIML) estimators in the case with many weak instruments. We show that in some interesting cases, TSLS and LIML can be approximated by maximizing the random effects likelihood subject to particular constraints. We show that statistics based on comparisons of the unconstrained estimates of these parameters to the implicit TSLS and LIML restrictions can be used to identify settings when standard large sample approximations to the distributions of TSLS and LIML are likely to perform poorly. We also show that with many weak instruments, LIML confidence intervals are likely to have under-coverage, even though its finite sample distribution is approximately centered at the true value of the parameter. In an application with real data and simulations around this data set, the proposed estimator performs markedly better than TSLS and LIML, both in terms of coverage rate and in terms of risk.",Gary Chamberlain and Guido Imbens,Gary Chamberlain,Guido Imbens,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The well-known F test of Chow (1960) for this problem only applies in a linear regression model with normally distributed iid errors and strictly exogenous regressors, even when the total number of observations, n + m, is large. We generalize the F test to cover regression models with much more general error processes, regressors that are not strictly exogenous, and estimation by instrumental variables as well as least squares. In addition, we extend the F test to nonlinear models estimated by generalized method of moments and maximum likelihood. Asymptotic critical values that are valid as n → ∞ with m fixed are provided using a subsampling-like method.

The model shows how the exposure to trade will induce only the more productive firms to enter the export market (while some less productive firms continue to produce only for the domestic market) and will simultaneously force the least productive firms to exit. It then shows how further increases in the industry's exposure to trade lead to additional inter-firm reallocations towards more productive firms. The paper also shows how the aggregate industry productivity growth generated by the reallocations contributes to a welfare gain, thus highlighting a benefit from trade that has not been examined theoretically before. The paper adapts Hopenhayn's (1992a) dynamic industry model to monopolistic competition in a general equilibrium setting. In so doing, the paper provides an extension of Krugman's (1980) trade model that incorporates firm level productivity differences. Firms with different productivity levels coexist in an industry because each firm faces initial uncertainty concerning its productivity before making an irreversible investment to enter the industry. Entry into the export market is also costly, but the firm's decision to export occurs after it gains knowledge of its productivity.",Marc J. Melitz,Marc J. Melitz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We allow one or more of them to be unknown real values, in which case Robinson and Marinucci (2001, 2003) have justified least squares estimates of the cointegrating vector, as well as narrow-band frequency-domain estimates, which may be less biased. While consistent, these estimates do not always have optimal convergence rates, and they have nonstandard limit distributional behavior. We consider estimates formulated in the frequency domain, that consequently allow for a wide variety of (parametric) autocorrelation in the short memory input series, as well as time-domain estimates based on autoregressive transformation. Both can be interpreted as approximating generalized least squares and Gaussian maximum likelihood estimates. The estimates share the same limiting distribution, having mixed normal asymptotics (yielding Wald test statistics with χ <sup>2</sup> null limit distributions), irrespective of whether the integration orders are known or unknown, subject in the latter case to their estimation with adequate rates of convergence.

We examine an economy with a single perishable consumption good, where the only collateral available consists of productive assets. In this model, competitive equilibria always exist and we show that, under the assumption that all exogenous variables follow a Markov chain, there also exist stationary equilibria. These equilibria can be characterized by a mapping from the exogenous shock and the current distribution of financial wealth to prices and portfolio choices.

Although firms in the market make different offers in equilibrium, all post a wage-tenure contract that implies a worker's wage increases smoothly with tenure at the firm. As firms make different offers, there is job turnover, as employed workers move jobs as the opportunity arises. This implies the increase in a worker's wage can be due to job-to-job movements as well as wage-tenure effects. Further, there is a nondegenerate equilibrium distribution of initial wage offers that is differentiable on its support except for a mass point at the lowest initial wage.

When T/N → 0 the fixed T results for GMM and LIML remain valid, but WG, although consistent, has an asymptotic bias in its asymptotic distribution. When T/N tends to a positive constant, the WG, GMM, and LIML estimators exhibit negative asymptotic biases of order 1/T, 1/N, and 1/(2N - T), respectively. In addition, the crude GMM estimator that neglects the autocorrelation in first differenced errors is inconsistent as T/N → c > 0, despite being consistent for fixed T.

If assignment to the treatment is exogenous or unconfounded, that is, independent of the potential outcomes given covariates, biases associated with simple treatment-control average comparisons can be removed by adjusting for differences in the covariates. Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) show that adjusting solely for differences between treated and control units in the propensity score removes all biases associated with differences in covariates. Although adjusting for differences in the propensity score removes all the bias, this can come at the expense of efficiency, as shown by Hahn (1998), Heckman, Ichimura, and Todd (1998), and Robins, Mark, and Newey (1992). We show that weighting by the inverse of a nonparametric estimate of the propensity score, rather than the true propensity score, leads to an efficient estimate of the average treatment effect. We provide intuition for this result by showing that this estimator can be interpreted as an empirical likelihood estimator that efficiently incorporates the information about the propensity score.","Keisuke Hirano, Guido W.

Mortality rates in patient discharge records are widely used to infer hospital quality. However, hospital admission is not random and some hospitals may attract patients with greater unobserved severity of illness than others. In this situation the assumption of random admission leads to spurious inference about hospital quality. This study controls for hospital selection using a model in which distance between the patient's residence and alternative hospitals are key exogenous variables. Bayesian inference in this model is feasible using a Markov chain Monte Carlo posterior simulator, and attaches posterior probabilities to quality comparisons between individual hospitals and groups of hospitals. The study uses data on 74,848 Medicare patients admitted to 114 hospitals in Los Angeles County from 1989 through 1992 with a diagnosis of pneumonia. It finds the smallest and largest hospitals to be of the highest quality. There is strong evidence of dependence between the unobserved severity of illness and the assignment of patients to hospitals, whereby patients with a high unobserved severity of illness are disproportionately admitted to high quality hospitals. Consequently a conventional probit model leads to inferences about quality that are markedly different from those in this study's selection model.","John Geweke, Gautam Gowrisankaran and Robert J.

We find that many unit root tests are closely related to specific members of the optimal family, but the corresponding members employ very different weightings for the initial condition. The popular Dickey-Fuller tests, for instance, put a large weight on extreme deviations of the initial observation from the deterministic component, whereas other popular tests put more weight on moderate deviations. Since the power of unit root tests varies dramatically with the initial condition, this paper explains the results of comparative power studies of unit root tests.

It is more general than previous bootstrap approaches to the unit root problem in that it allows for a very wide class of weakly dependent processes and it is not based on any parametric assumption on the process generating the data. As a consequence the procedure can accurately capture the distribution of many unit root test statistics proposed in the literature. Large sample theory is developed and the asymptotic validity of the block bootstrap-based unit root testing is shown via a bootstrap functional limit theorem. Applications to some particular test statistics of the unit root hypothesis, i.e., least squares and Dickey-Fuller type statistics are given.

We show that this requirement entails substantial restrictions on the set of implementable social choice rules.

The approach involves the concept of minimal information loss in time series regression and the paper shows how to derive bounds that delimit the proximity of empirical measures to the true probability measure (the DGP) in models that are of econometric interest. The approach utilizes joint probability measures over the combined space of parameters and observables and the results apply for models with stationary, integrated, and cointegrated data. A theorem due to Rissanen is extended so that it applies directly to probabilities about the relative likelihood (rather than averages), a new way of proving results of the Rissanen type is demonstrated, and the Rissanen theory is extended to nonstationary time series with unit roots, near unit roots, and cointegration of unknown order. The corresponding bound for the minimal information loss in empirical work is shown not to be a constant, in general, but to be proportional to the logarithm of the determinant of the (possibility stochastic) Fisher-information matrix. In fact, the bound that determines proximity to the DGP is generally path dependent, and it depends specifically on the type as well as the number of regressors. For practical purposes, the proximity bound has the asymptotic form (K/2) log n, where K is a new dimensionality factor that depends on the nature of the data as well as the number of parameters in the model. When 'good' model selection principles are employed in modeling time series data, we are able to show that our proximity bound quantifies empirical limits even in situations where the models may be incorrectly specified. One of the main implications of the new result is that time trends are more costly than stochastic trends, which are more costly in turn than stationary regressors in achieving proximity to the true density. Thus, in a very real sense and quantifiable manner, the DGP is more elusive when there is nonstationarity in the data. The implications for prediction are explored and a second proximity theorem is given, which provides a bound that measures how close feasible predictors can come to the optimal predictor. Again, the bound has the asymptotic form (K/2) log n, showing that forecasting trends is fundamentally more difficult than forecasting stationary time series, even when the correct form of the model for the trends is known.",Werner Ploberger and Peter C.

The bias-reduced estimator is the same as the GPH estimator except that one includes frequencies to the power 2k for k = 1,..., r, for some positive integer r, as additional regressors in the pseudo-regression model that yields the GPH estimator. The reduction in bias is obtained using assumptions on the spectrum only in a neighborhood of the zero frequency. Following the work of Robinson (1995b) and Hurvich, Deo, and Brodsky (1998), we establish the asymptotic bias, variance, and mean-squared error (MSE) of <tex-math>$\hat d_r$</tex-math>, determine the asymptotic MSE optimal choice of the number of frequencies, m, to include in the regression, and establish the asymptotic normality of <tex-math>$\hat d_r$</tex-math>. These results show that the bias of <tex-math>$\hat d_r$</tex-math> goes to zero at a faster rate than that of the GPH estimator when the normalized spectrum at zero is sufficiently smooth, but that its variance only is increased by a multiplicative constant. We show that the bias-reduced estimator <tex-math>$\hat d_r$</tex-math> attains the optimal rate of convergence for a class of spectral densities that includes those that are smooth of order s ≥ 1 at zero when r ≥ (s-2)/2 and m is chosen appropriately. For s > 2, the GPH estimator does not attain this rate. The proof uses results of Giraitis, Robinson, and Samarov (1997). We specify a data-dependent plug-in method for selecting the number of frequencies m to minimize asymptotic MSE for a given value of r.

We show that the estimated common components are asymptotically normal with a convergence rate equal to the minimum of the square roots of N and T. The estimated factors and their loadings are generally normal, although not always so. The convergence rate of the estimated factors and factor loadings can be faster than that of the estimated common components.

We show how to identify the drift and diffusion function in situations where one or the other function is considered a nuisance parameter. The asymptotic behavior of the estimators is examined as the observation frequency increases and as the time span lengthens. We prove almost sure consistency and weak convergence to mixtures of normal laws, where the mixing variates depend on the chronological local time of the underlying diffusion process, that is the random time spent by the process in the vicinity of a generic spatial point. The estimation method and asymptotic results apply to both stationary and nonstationary recurrent processes.",Federico M. Bandi and Peter C. B. Phillips,Federico M. Bandi,Peter C. B.

These include financial time series, which can be particularly heavy tailed. However, little is known about properties of ARCH or GARCH models in the heavy-tailed setting, and no methods are available for approximating the distributions of parameter estimators there. In this paper we show that, for heavy-tailed errors, the asymptotic distributions of quasi-maximum likelihood parameter estimators in ARCH and GARCH models are nonnormal, and are particularly difficult to estimate directly using standard parametric methods. Standard bootstrap methods also fail to produce consistent estimators. To overcome these problems we develop percentile-t, subsample bootstrap approximations to estimator distributions. Studentizing is employed to approximate scale, and the subsample bootstrap is used to estimate shape. The good performance of this approach is demonstrated both theoretically and numerically.",Peter Hall and Qiwei Yao,Peter Hall,Qiwei Yao,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We consider a general specification of the latent demand and information structure, nesting both private values and common values models, and allowing correlated types as well as ex ante asymmetry. We address identification of a series of nested models and derive testable restrictions enabling discrimination between models on the basis of observed data. The simplest model-symmetric independent private values-is nonparametrically identified even if only the transaction price from each auction is observed. For richer models, identification and testable restrictions may be obtained when additional information of one or more of the following types is available: (i) the identity of the winning bidder or other bidders; (ii) one or more bids in addition to the transaction price; (iii) exogenous variation in the number of bidders; (iv) bidder-specific covariates. While many private values (PV) models are nonparametrically identified and testable with commonly available data, identification of common values (CV) models requires stringent assumptions. Nonetheless, the PV model can be tested against the CV alternative, even when neither model is identified.",Susan Athey and Philip A. Haile,Susan Athey,Philip A. Haile,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

In particular, the expected motion of stochastic fictitious play and reinforcement learning with experimentation can both be written as a perturbed form of the evolutionary replicator dynamics. Therefore they will in many cases have the same asymptotic behavior. In particular, local stability of mixed equilibria under stochastic fictitious play implies local stability under perturbed reinforcement learning. The main identifiable difference between the two models is speed: stochastic fictitious play gives rise to faster learning.",Ed Hopkins,Ed Hopkins,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The key result in our analysis of supermodular games is that the relevant differential equation defines a strongly monotone dynamical system. Our analyses of the other cases combine Lyapunov function arguments with a discrete choice theory result: that the choice probabilities generated by any additive random utility model can be derived from a deterministic model based on payoff perturbations that depend nonlinearly on the vector of choice probabilities.",Josef Hofbauer and William H.

Firms make take-it-or-leave-it wage offers to workers conditional on their characteristics and they can respond to the outside job offers received by their employees. Unobserved worker productive heterogeneity is introduced in the form of cross-worker differences in a ""competence"" parameter. On the other side of the market, firms also are heterogeneous with respect to their marginal productivity of labor. The model delivers a theory of steady-state wage dispersion driven by heterogenous worker abilities and firm productivities, as well as by matching frictions. The structural model is estimated using matched employer and employee French panel data. The exogenous distributions of worker and firm heterogeneity components are nonparametrically estimated. We use this structural estimation to provide a decomposition of cross-employee wage variance. We find that the share of the cross-sectional wage variance that is explained by person effects varies across skill groups. Specifically, this share lies close to 40% for high-skilled white collars, and quickly decreases to 0% as the observed skill level decreases. The contribution of market imperfections to wage dispersion is typically around 50%.",Fabien Postel-Vinay and Jean-Marc Robin,Fabien Postel-Vinay,Jean-Marc Robin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

To assess the impact of self-selection on estimated returns, this paper first develops a Roy model of mobility and earnings where workers choose in which of the 50 states (plus the District of Columbia) to live and work. Available estimation methods are either infeasible for a selection model with so many alternatives or place potentially severe restrictions on earnings and the selection process. This paper develops an alternative econometric methodology that combines Lee's (1983) parametric maximum order statistic approach to reduce the dimensionality of the error terms with more recent work on semiparametric estimation of selection models (e.g., Ahn and Powell (1993)). The resulting semiparametric correction is easy to implement and can be adapted to a variety of other polychotomous choice problems. The empirical work, which uses 1990 U.S. Census data, confirms the role of comparative advantage in mobility decisions. The results suggest that self-selection of higher educated individuals to states with higher returns to education generally leads to upward biases in OLS estimates of the returns to education in state-specific labor markets. While the estimated returns to a college education are significantly biased, correcting for the bias does not narrow the range of returns across states. Consistent with the finding that the corrected return to a college education differs across the U.S., the relative state-to-state migration flows of college- versus high school-educated individuals respond strongly to differences in the return to education and amenities across states.",Gordon B.

Then we can do nonparametric regression where the variable in the regression is the budget set. We reduce the dimensionality of this problem by exploiting structure implied by utility maximization with piecewise linear convex budget sets. This structure leads to estimators where the number of segments can differ across observations and does not affect accuracy. We give consistency and asymptotic normality results for these estimators. The usefulness of the estimator is demonstrated in an empirical example, where we find it has a large impact on estimated effects of the Swedish tax reform.",Sören Blomquist and Whitney Newey,Sören Blomquist,Whitney Newey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Typically, the discontinuities arise from indeterminacies (ties) in the underlying problem. The point of view taken here is that the tie-breaking rules that resolve these indeterminacies should be viewed as part of the solution rather than part of the description of the model. A solution is therefore a tie-breaking rule together with strategies satisfying the usual best-response criterion. When information is incomplete, solutions need not exist; that is, there may be no tie-breaking rule that is compatible with the existence of strategy profiles satisfying the usual bestresponse criteria. It is shown that the introduction of incentive compatible communication (cheap talk) restores existence.","Matthew O. Jackson, Leo K. Simon, Jeroen M. Swinkels and William R. Zame",Matthew O.

The correction factor depends on moments of functions of the random walk, which are tabulated by simulation, and functions of the parameters, which are estimated.

Market design involves a responsibility for detail, a need to deal with all of a market's complications, not just its principle features. Designers therefore cannot work only with the simple conceptual models used for theoretical insights into the general working of markets. Instead, market design calls for an engineering approach. Drawing primarily on the design of the entry level labor market for American doctors (the National Resident Matching Program), and of the auctions of radio spectrum conducted by the Federal Communications Commission, this paper makes the case that experimental and computational economics are natural complements to game theory in the work of design. The paper also argues that some of the challenges facing both markets involve dealing with related kinds of complementarities, and that this suggests an agenda for future theoretical research.",Alvin E.

Our method is based on a representation of the solution of the dynamic programming problem in the space of conditional choice probabilities. When the NPL algorithm is initialized with consistent nonparametric estimates of conditional choice probabilities, successive iterations return a sequence of estimators of the structural parameters which we call K-stage policy iteration estimators. We show that the sequence includes as extreme cases a Hotz-Miller estimator (for K = 1) and Rust's nested fixed point estimator (in the limit when K → ∞). Furthermore, the asymptotic distribution of all the estimators in the sequence is the same and equal to that of the maximum likelihood estimator. We illustrate the performance of our method with several examples based on Rust's bus replacement model.

We characterize this situation as ""the Durbin problem"" since it was posed in Durbin (1973), for parametric empirical processes. In this paper we consider an approach to the Durbin problem involving a martingale transformation of the parametric empirical process suggested by Khmaladze (1981) and show that it can be adapted to a wide variety of inference problems involving the quantile regression process. In particular, we suggest new tests of the location shift and location-scale shift models that underlie much of classical econometric inference.

The first puzzle concerns wage inequality between educational groups, which has substantially risen in the US and the UK during the past two decades following a sharp increase in the supply of educated labor.

Results from ongoing empirical work indicate that such effects are indeed present in the data. Some empirical results are consistent with theoretical predictions: presidential regimes have smaller governments and countries with majoritarian elections have smaller welfare-state programs and less corruption.

This paper introduces a friction into a standard model that helps resolve these anomalies. The friction is that international loans are imperfectly enforceable; any country can renege on its debts and suffer the consequences for future borrowing. To solve for equilibrium in this economy with endogenous incomplete markets, the methods of Marcet and Marimon (1999) are extended.

Unlike other investigators who have been forced to use observable proxies to approximate unobserved beliefs, we have, using a belief elicitation procedure (proper scoring rule), elicited subject beliefs directly. As a result we were able to perform a more direct test of the proposition that people behave in a manner consistent with belief learning. What we find is interesting. First to the extent that subjects tend to ""belief learn,"" the beliefs they use are the stated beliefs we elicit from them and not the ""empirical beliefs"" posited by fictitious play or Cournot models. Second, we present evidence that the stated beliefs of our subjects differ dramatically, both quantitatively and qualitatively, from the type of empirical or historical beliefs usually used as proxies for them. Third, our belief elicitation procedures allow us to examine how far we can be led astray when we are forced to infer the value of parameters using observable proxies for variables previously thought to be unobservable. By transforming a heretofore unobservable into an observable, we can see directly how parameter estimates change when this new information is introduced. Again, we demonstrate that such differences can be dramatic. Finally, our belief learning model using stated beliefs outperforms both a reinforcement and EWA model when all three models are estimated using our data.",Yaw Nyarko and Andrew Schotter,Yaw Nyarko,Andrew Schotter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

In this result the maximum risk is over commonly used specifications for the set of feasible data generating processes. The consequences for inference on unit roots and cointegration are discussed.

Both semiparametric and nonparametric regression formulations are considered, the latter including general systems of two-sided distributed lags such as those arising in lead and lag regressions. The bias problem arises through omitted variables and is avoided by careful specification of the regression equation. Trend removal in the frequency domain is shown to be a convenient option in practice. An asymptotic theory is developed and the two cases of stationary data and cointegrated nonstationary data are compared. In the latter case, a levels and differences regression formulation is shown to be useful in estimating the frequency response function at nonzero as well as zero frequencies.","Dean Corbae, Sam Ouliaris and Peter C.

Can we assist Noah in constructing his preferences? To address these questions, we propose a multi-attribute approach under which the diversity of a set of species is the sum of the values of all attributes possessed by some species in the set. We develop the basic intuitions and requirements for a theory of diversity and show that the multi-attribute approach satisfies them in a flexible yet tractable manner. A natural starting point is to think of the diversity of a set as an aggregate of the pairwise dissimilarities between its elements. The multi-attribute framework allows one to make this program formally precise. It is shown that the program can be realized if and only if the family of relevant attributes is well-ordered (""acyclic""). Moreover, there is a unique functional form aggregating dissimilarity into diversity, the length of a minimum spanning tree. Examples are taxonomic hierarchies and lines representing uni-dimensional qualities. In multi-dimensional settings, pairwise dissimilarity information among elements is insufficient to determine their diversity. By consequence, the qualitative and quantitative behavior of diversity differs fundamentally.",Klaus Nehring and Clemens Puppe,Klaus Nehring,Clemens Puppe,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Such redistributive policies entail distortions to labor supply and savings, but also serve as partial substitutes for missing credit and insurance markets. The resulting tradeoffs for growth and efficiency are explored, both theoretically and quantitatively, in a model that yields complete analytical solutions. Progressive education finance always leads to higher income growth than taxes and transfers, but at the cost of lower insurance. Overall efficiency is assessed using a new measure that properly reflects aggregate resources and idiosyncratic risks but, unlike a standard social welfare function, does not reward equality per se. Simulations using empirical parameter estimates show that the efficiency costs and benefits of redistribution are generally of the same order of magnitude, resulting in plausible values for the optimal rates.

Let a random sample be drawn from P and the realizations of <tex-math>$(y,x,v_{0},v_{1})$</tex-math> be observed, but not those of v. The problem of interest may be to infer E(y/x, v) or E(v/x). This analysis maintains Interval (I), Monotonicity (M), and Mean Independence (MI) assumptions: (I) <tex-math>$P(v_{0}\leq v\leq v_{1})=1$</tex-math>; (M) E(y/x, v) is monotone in v; (MI) <tex-math>$E(y|x,v,v_{0},v_{1})$</tex-math> = E(y/x, v).

This paper establishes parallel results for economies with finitely many consumers and infinitely many commodities. The most important new condition we introduce, quadratic concavity, rules out preferences in which goods are perfect substitutes globally, locally, or asymptotically.

The method is computationally efficient by virtue of using the sequence form, whose size is proportional to the size of the game tree. The equilibrium is traced on a piecewise linear path in the sequence form strategy space from an arbitrary starting vector. If the starting vector represents a pair of completely mixed strategies, then the equilibrium is normal form perfect. Computational experiments compare the sequence form and the reduced normal form, and show that only the sequence form is tractable for larger games.","Bernhard von Stengel, Antoon van den Elzen and Dolf Talman",Bernhard von Stengel,Antoon van den Elzen,Dolf Talman,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

In particular, it shows that a rank-dependent preference functional is obtained in this set-up when the independence axiom is weakened to stochastic dominance and a probability trade-off consistency condition. In contrast with the existing axiomatizations of rank-dependent utility, the resulting axioms allow for complete flexibility regarding the outcome space. Consequently, a parameter-free test/elicitation of rank-dependent utility becomes possible. The probability-oriented approach of this paper also provides theoretical foundations for probabilistic attitudes towards risk. It is shown that the preference conditions that characterize the shape of the probability weighting function can be derived from simple probability trade-off conditions.",Mohammed Abdellaoui,Mohammed Abdellaoui,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The quantile treatment effects (QTE) estimator reduces to quantile regression when selection for treatment is exogenously determined. QTE can be computed as the solution to a convex linear programming problem, although this requires first-step estimation of a nuisance function. We develop distribution theory for the case where the first step is estimated nonparametrically. For women, the empirical results show that the JTPA program had the largest proportional impact at low quantiles. Perhaps surprisingly, however, JTPA training raised the quantiles of earnings for men only in the upper half of the trainee earnings distribution.","Alberto Abadie, Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens",Alberto Abadie,Joshua Angrist,Guido Imbens,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Under the null hypothesis that conventional first order asymptotics provide a reliable guide to inference, the two estimates should be very similar. Our test sees whether the resulting difference in the two estimates satisfies the results of second order asymptotic theory. Essentially the same idea is applied to develop another new specification test using second-order unbiased estimators of the type first proposed by Nagar. If the forward and reverse Nagar-type estimators are not significantly different we recommend estimation by LIML, which we demonstrate is the optimal linear combination of the Nagar-type estimators (to second order).

We focus on quasi linear contractions where Γ is a nonlinear functional of a finite number of conditional expectation operators. This class includes contractive Fredholm integral equations that arise in asset pricing applications and the contractive Bellman equation from dynamic programming. In the absence of further restrictions on the domain of Γ, the quasi linear fixed point problem is subject to the curse of dimensionality, i.e., in the worst case the minimal number of function evaluations and arithmetic operations required to compute an ε-approximation to a fixed point <tex-math>$V^{\ast}\in B_{d}$</tex-math> increases exponentially in d. We show that the curse of dimensionality disappears if the domain of Γ has additional special structure. We identify a particular type of special structure for which the problem is strongly tractable even in the worst case, i.e., the number of function evaluations and arithmetic operations needed to compute an ε-approximation of V* is bounded by <tex-math>$C\varepsilon ^{-p}$</tex-math> where C and p are constants independent of d. We present examples of economic problems that have this type of special structure including a class of rational expectations asset pricing problems for which the optimal exponent p = 1 is nearly achieved.","J.

It takes into account the fact that the bias in the sum of the autoregressive coefficients is highly dependent on k and adapts to the type of deterministic components present. We use a local asymptotic framework in which the moving-average root is local to -1 to document how the MIC performs better in selecting appropriate values of k.

We find that the asymptotic null distribution of Wald tests for a threshold are nonstandard and different from the stationary case, and suggest basing inference on a bootstrap approximation. We also study the asymptotic null distributions of tests for an autoregressive unit root, and find that they are nonstandard and dependent on the presence of a threshold effect. We propose both asymptotic and bootstrap-based tests. These tests and distribution theory allow for the joint consideration of nonlinearity (thresholds) and nonstationary (unit roots). Our limit theory is based on a new set of tools that combine unit root asymptotics with empirical process methods. We work with a particular two-parameter empirical process that converges weakly to a two-parameter Brownian motion. Our limit distributions involve stochastic integrals with respect to this two-parameter process. This theory is entirely new and may find applications in other contexts. We illustrate the methods with an application to the U.S. monthly unemployment rate. We find strong evidence of a threshold effect. The point estimates suggest that the threshold effect is in theshort-run dynamics, rather than in the dominate root. While the conventional ADF test for a unit root is insignificant, our TAR unit root tests are arguably significant. The evidence is quite strong that the unemployment rate is not a unit root process, and there is considerable evidence that the series is a stationary TAR process.",Mehmet Caner and Bruce E.

A simple theoretical model that highlights the role of comparative advantage in the optimal schooling decision is presented and used to motivate an extended discussion of econometric issues, including the properties of ordinary least squares and instrumental variables estimators. A review of studies that have used compulsory schooling laws, differences in the accessibility of schools, and similar features as instrumental variables for completed education, reveals that the resulting estimates of the return to schooling are typically as big or bigger than the corresponding ordinary least squares estimates. One interpretation of this finding is that marginal returns to education among the low-education subgroups typically affected by supply-side innovations tend to be relatively high, reflecting their high marginal costs of schooling, rather than low ability that limits their return to education.",David Card,David Card,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

First, the integral that determines continuation values is never calculated; rather it is approximated by a simple average of returns from past outcomes of the algorithm, an approximation whose computational burden is not tied to the dimension of the state space. Second, iterations of the algorithm update value and policy functions at a single (rather than at all possible) points in the state space. Random draws from a distribution set by the updated policies determine the location of the next iteration's updates. This selection only repeatedly hits the recurrent class of points, a subset whose cardinality is not directly tied to that of the state space. Numerical results for industrial organization problems show that our algorithm can increase speed and decrease memory requirements by several orders of magnitude.",Ariel Pakes and Paul McGuire,Ariel Pakes,Paul McGuire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Interest focuses on the sum of the autoregressive coefficients because this parameter provides a useful scalar measure of the long-run persistence properties of an economic time series. Since the type of the limiting distribution of the corresponding OLS estimator, as well as the rate of its convergence, depend in a discontinuous fashion upon whether the true parameter is less than one or equal to one (that is, trend-stationary case or unit root case), the construction of confidence intervals is notoriously difficult. The crux of our method is to recompute the OLS estimator on smaller blocks of the observed data, according to the general subsampling idea of Politis and Romano (1994a), although some extensions of the standard theory are needed. The method is more general than previous approaches in that it works for arbitrary parameter values, but also because it allows the innovations to be a martingale difference sequence rather than i.i.d. Some simulation studies examine the finite sample performance.",Joseph P. Romano and Michael Wolf,Joseph P. Romano,Michael Wolf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The first case arises when partitions are independently drawn, and each individual's information is determined by their own partition and some public signal. In this case common knowledge of the value of the aggregator function implies (with probability one) that the individual statistics are constant, so that in the case where the individual statistics have the same expected value, they must all be equal. The second circumstance is where private statistics are related: affiliation of individual statistics and a lattice condition imply that the individual statistics are equal when the value of the aggregate statistic is common knowledge.",James Bergin,James Bergin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The main result establishes existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria (PSNE) under a condition we call the single crossing condition (SCC), roughly described as follows: whenever each opponent uses a nondecreasing strategy (in the sense that higher types choose higher actions), a player's best response strategy is also nondecreasing. When the SCC holds, a PSNE exists in every finite-action game. Further, for games with continuous payoffs and a continuum of actions, there exists a sequence of PSNE to finite-action games that converges to a PSNE of the continuum-action game. These convergence and existence results also extend to some classes of games with discontinuous payoffs, such as first-price auctions, where bidders may be heterogeneous and reserve prices are permitted. Finally, the paper characterizes the SCC based on properties of utility functions and probability distributions over types. Applications include first-price, multi-unit, and all-pay auctions; pricing games with incomplete information about costs; and noisy signaling games.",Susan Athey,Susan Athey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We enrich the choice set, consequently obtaining uniqueness results that were not possible in Kreps' model. We consider several representations and allow the agent to prefer commitment in some contingencies. In the representations, the agent acts as if she had coherent beliefs about a set of possible future (ex post) preferences, each of which is an expected-utility preference. We show that this set of ex post preferences, called the subjective state space, is essentially unique given the restriction that all ex post preferences are expected-utility preferences and is minimal even without this restriction. Because the subjective state space is identified, the way ex post utilities are aggregated into an ex ante ranking is also essentially unique. Hence when a representation that is additive across states exists, the additivity is meaningful in the sense that all representations are intrinsically additive. Uniqueness enables us to show that the size of the subjective state space provides a measure of the agent's uncertainty about future contingencies and that the way the states are aggregated indicates whether these contingencies lead to a desire for flexibility or commitment.","Eddie Dekel, Barton L.

In the rank-dependent theories, a new dimension is added: chance attitude, modeled in terms of nonadditive measures or nonlinear probability transformations that are independent of utility. Most empirical studies of chance attitude assume probabilities given and adopt parametric fitting for estimating the probability transformation. Only a few qualitative conditions have been proposed or tested as yet, usually quasi-concavity or quasi-convexity in the case of given probabilities. This paper presents a general method of studying qualitative properties of chance attitude such as optimism, pessimism, and the ""inverse-S shape"" pattern, both for risk and for uncertainty. These qualitative properties can be characterized by permitting appropriate, relatively simple, violations of the sure-thing principle. In particular, this paper solves a hitherto open problem: the preference axiomatization of convex (""pessimistic"" or ""uncertainty averse"") nonadditive measures under uncertainty. The axioms of this paper preserve the central feature of rank-dependent theories, i.e. the separation of chance attitude and utility.",Peter P. Wakker,Peter P. Wakker,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We propose viewing μ(·) itself as the outcome of a random process. The paper introduces a new stationary random field m(·) that generalizes finite-differenced Brownian motion to a vector field and whose realizations could represent a broad class of possible forms for μ(·). We view the parameters that characterize the relation between a given realization of m(·) and the particular value of μ(·) for a given sample as population parameters to be estimated by maximum likelihood or Bayesian methods. We show that the resulting inference about the functional relation also yields consistent estimates for a broad class of deterministic functions μ(·). The paper further develops a new test of the null hypothesis of linearity based on the Lagrange multiplier principle and small-sample confidence intervals based on numerical Bayesian methods.

This paper empirically examines this conclusion. In particular, I estimate price-cost margins, but more importantly I am able empirically to separate these margins into three sources: (i) that which is due to product differentiation; (ii) that which is due to multi-product firm pricing; and (iii) that due to potential price collusion. The results suggest that given the demand for different brands of cereal, the first two effects explain most of the observed price-cost margins. I conclude that prices in the industry are consistent with noncollusive pricing behavior, despite the high price-cost margins.

This seems unreasonable in a world where transportation and transaction costs appear so low as to encourage arbitrage and the convergence of price gaps over much shorter horizons, typically days or weeks. However, current empirics rely on a particular choice of methodology, involving (i) relatively low-frequency monthly, quarterly, or annual data, and (ii) a linear model specification. In fact, these methodological choices are not innocent, and they can be shown to bias analysis towards findings of slow convergence and a random walk. Intuitively, if we suspect that the actual adjustment horizon is of the order of days, then monthly and annual data cannot be expected to reveal it. If we suspect arbitrage costs are high enough to produce a substantial ""band of inaction,"" then a linear model will fail to support convergence if the process spends considerable time random-walking in that band.

The paper then provides a first 2and preliminary analysis of the concept of the stakeholder society. It investigates whether the managerial incentives and the control structure described in the first part can be modified so as to promote the stakeholder society. It shows that the implementation of the stakeholder society strikes three rocks: dearth of pledgeable income, deadlocks in decision-making, and lack of clear mission for management. While it fares better than the stakeholder society on those three grounds, shareholder value generates biased decision-making; the paper analyzes the costs and benefits of various methods of protecting noncontrolling stakeholders: covenants, exit options, flat claims, enlarged fiduciary duty.",Jean Tirole,Jean Tirole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

I analyze long-term debt and optimal policy in the fiscal theory. I find that the maturity structure of the debt matters. For example, it determines whether news of future deficits implies current inflation or future inflation. When long-term debt is present, the government can trade current inflation for future inflation by debt operations; this tradeoff is not present if the government rolls over short-term debt. The maturity structure of outstanding debt acts as a ""budget constraint"" determining which periods' price levels the government can affect by debt variation alone. In addition, debt policy-the expected pattern of future state-contingent debt sales, repurchases and redemptions-matters crucially for the effects of a debt operation. I solve for optimal debt policies to minimize the variance of inflation. I find cases in which long-term debt helps to stabilize inflation. I also find that the optimal policy produces time series that are similar to U.S. surplus and debt time series. To understand the data, I must assume that debt policy offsets the inflationary impact of cyclical surplus shocks, rather than causing price level disturbances by policy-induced shocks. Shifting the objective from price level variance to inflation variance, the optimal policy produces much less volatile inflation at the cost of a unit root in the price level; this is consistent with the stabilization of U.S. inflation after the gold standard was abandoned.",John H.

Moreover, delays in agreement are also possible in such equilibria. By limiting ourselves to a plausible notion of complexity that captures length of memory, we find that the introduction of complexity costs (lexicographically with the standard payoffs) does not reduce the range of possible allocations but does limit the amount of delay that can occur in any agreement. In particular, we show that in any n-player game, for any allocation z, an agreement on z at any period t can be sustained as a Nash equilibrium of the game with complexity costs if and only if t ≤ n. We use the limit on delay result to establish that, in equilibrium, the strategies implement stationary behavior.

The relative quantity of skilled labor has increased substantially, and the skill premium, which is the wage of skilled labor relative to that of unskilled labor, has grown significantly since 1980. Many studies have found that accounting for the increase in the skill premium on the basis of observable variables is difficult and have concluded implicitly that latent skill-biased technological change must be the main factor responsible. This paper examines that view systematically. We develop a framework that provides a simple, explicit economic mechanism for understanding skill-biased technological change in terms of observable variables, and we use the framework to evaluate the fraction of variation in the skill premium that can be accounted for by changes in observed factor quantities. We find that with capital-skill complementarity, changes in observed inputs alone can account for most of the variations in the skill premium over the last 30 years.","Per Krusell, Lee E.

It is widely acknowledged by empirical researchers that data snooping is a dangerous practice to be avoided, but in fact it is endemic. The main problem has been a lack of sufficiently simple practical methods capable of assessing the potential dangers of data snooping in a given situation. Our purpose here is to provide such methods by specifying a straightforward procedure for testing the null hypothesis that the best model encountered in a specification search has no predictive superiority over a given benchmark model.

Persistent output fluctuations require endogenous price stickiness in the sense that firms choose not to change prices much when they can do so.

Thus individual links generate externalities whose value depends on the level of decay/delay associated with indirect links. A distinctive aspect of our approach is that the costs of link formation are incurred only by the person who initiates the link. This allows us to formulate the network formation process as a noncooperative game. We first provide a characterization of the architecture of equilibrium networks. We then study the dynamics of network formation. We find that individual efforts to access benefits offered by others lead, rapidly, to the emergence of an equilibrium social network, under a variety of circumstances.

Both logit and probit models are covered. The maximum likelihood (ML) estimator is consistent but a new phenomenon arises in its limit distribution theory. The estimator consists of a mixture of two components, one of which is parallel to and the other orthogonal to the direction of the true parameter vector, with the latter being the principal component. The ML estimator is shown to converge at a rate of n<sup>3/4</sup> along its principal component but has the slower rate of n<sup>1/4</sup> convergence in all other directions. This is the first instance known to the authors of multiple convergence rates in models where the regressors have the same (full rank) stochastic order and where the parameters appear in linear forms of these regressors. It is a consequence of the fact that the estimating equations involve nonlinear integrable transformations of linear forms of integrated processes as well as polynomials in these processes, and the asymptotic behavior of these elements is quite different. The limit distribution of the ML estimator is derived and is shown to be a mixture of two mixed normal distributions with mixing variates that are dependent upon Brownian local time as well as Brownian motion. It is further shown that the sample proportion of binary choices follows an arc sine law and therefore spends most of its time in the neighborhood of zero or unity. The result has implications for policy decision making that involves binary choices and where the decisions depend on economic fundamentals that involve stochastic trends. Our limit theory shows that, in such conditions, policy is likely to manifest streams of little intervention or intensive intervention.",Joon Y. Park and Peter C. B. Phillips,Joon Y. Park,Peter C. B.

It is symmetric and differentiable and exhibits typical features of market-power: Equilibrium trading volume is lower than ex ante efficiency would require.

We also consider identification in the semiparametric case where the logit assumption is relaxed. We propose an estimator in the spirit of the conditional maximum score estimator (Manski (1987)), and we show that it is consistent.

The main elements of the situations studied here are that the employment contracts are non-binding across periods of production and that the firm has opportunities to replace workers. The paper analyzes a dynamic model in which the processes of contracting and recontracting between the firm and its workers are intertwined with the dynamic evolution of the firm's workforce. The analysis of the model is somewhat complicated because the employment level is a nondegenerate state variable that evolves over time and is affected by past decisions. The main analytical results characterize certain important equilibria: the profit maximizing and stationary equilibria. The unique stationary equilibrium is markedly inefficient: it exhibits inefficient over-employment and the steady state wages coincide with the workers' reservation wage. It confirms earlier results derived by Stole and Zwiebel (1996a,b) in the context of a static model and shows that they are very robust even when the firm has nearly frictionless hiring opportunities. In contrast, in the profit maximizing equilibrium the outcome is nearly efficient and the wage exhibits a mark-up over the reservation wage.",Asher Wolinsky,Asher Wolinsky,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

In general this term has order larger than the n<sup>-1/2</sup> that prevails in standard parametric problems, but we find circumstances in which it is O(n<sup>-1/2</sup>), thereby extending the achievement of an n<sup>-1/2</sup> Berry-Esseen bound in Robinson (1995a).

A unanimous neutral social choice function turns out to be universally self-selective if and only if it is Paretian and satisfies independence of irrelevant alternatives. The neutral unanimous social choice functions whose domains consist of linear order profiles on nonempty sets of any finite cardinality induce a class of social welfare functions that inherit Paretianism and independence of irrelevant alternatives in case the social choice function with which one starts is universally self-selective. Thus, a unanimous and neutral social choice function is universally self-selective if and only if it is dictatorial. Moreover, universal self-selectivity for such functions is equivalent to the conjunction of strategy-proofness and independence of irrelevant alternatives or the conjunction of monotonicity and independence of irrelevant alternatives again.",Semih Koray,Semih Koray,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Using the theory of minimax, we establish the best rate of uniform convergence at which the latent density of private values can be estimated nonparametrically from available data. We then propose a two-step kernel-based estimator that converges at the optimal rate.","Emmanuel Guerre, Isabelle Perrigne and Quang Vuong",Emmanuel Guerre,Isabelle Perrigne,Quang Vuong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Direct applications include models of separating and multiple equilibria. Other applications include empirical sample splitting when the sample split is based on a continuously-distributed variable such as firm size. In addition, threshold models may be used as a parsimonious strategy for nonparametric function estimation. For example, the threshold autoregressive model (TAR) is popular in the nonlinear time series literature. Threshold models also emerge as special cases of more complex statistical frameworks, such as mixture models, switching models, Markov switching models, and smooth transition threshold models. It may be important to understand the statistical properties of threshold models as a preliminary step in the development of statistical tools to handle these more complicated structures. Despite the large number of potential applications, the statistical theory of threshold estimation is undeveloped. It is known that threshold estimates are super-consistent, but a distribution theory useful for testing and inference has yet to be provided. This paper develops a statistical theory for threshold estimation in the regression context. We allow for either cross-section or time series observations. Least squares estimation of the regression parameters is considered. An asymptotic distribution theory for the regression estimates (the threshold and the regression slopes) is developed. It is found that the distribution of the threshold estimate is nonstandard. A method to construct asymptotic confidence intervals is developed by inverting the likelihood ratio statistic. It is shown that this yields asymptotically conservative confidence regions. Monte Carlo simulations are presented to assess the accuracy of the asymptotic approximations. The empirical relevance of the theory is illustrated through an application to the multiple equilibria growth model of Durlauf and Johnson (1995).",Bruce E. Hansen,Bruce E.

A new experiment involving multistage asymmetric-information games is conducted, and the experimental data are compared with the predictions of Nash equilibrium and two types of learning model: a reinforcement-based model similar to that used by Roth and Erev (1995), and belief-based models similar to the ""cautious fictitious play"" of Fudenberg and Levine (1995, 1998). These models make predictions that are qualitatively similar-cycling around the Nash equilibrium that is much more apparent than movement toward it. While subject behavior is not adequately described by Nash equilibrium, it is consistent with the qualitative predictions of the learning models. We examine several criteria for quantitatively comparing the predictions of alternative models. According to almost all of these criteria, both types of learning model outperform Nash equilibrium. According to some criteria, the reinforcement-based model performs better than any version of the belief-based model; according to others, there exist versions of the belief-based model that outperform the reinforcement-based model. The abilities of these models are further tested with respect to the results of other published experiments. The relative performance of the two learning models depends on the experiment, and varies according to which criterion of success is used. Again, both models perform better than equilibrium in most cases.",Nick Feltovich,Nick Feltovich,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

In the model where the commodity comes in indivisible units, the three axioms characterize the family of priority rules, where individual demands are met lexicographically according to an exogeneous ordering of the agents. In the (more familiar) model where the commodity is divisible, these three axioms plus Scale Invariance-independence of the measurement unit-characterize a rich family of methods. It contains exactly three symmetric methods, giving equal shares to equal demands: these are the familiar proportional, uniform gains, and uniform losses methods.

Our analysis: tests the extent to which the option approach can explain default and prepayment behavior; evaluates the practical importance of modeling both options simultaneously; and models the unobserved heterogeneity of borrowers in the home mortgage market. The paper presents a unified model of the competing risks of mortgage termination by prepayment and default, considering the two hazards as dependent competing risks that are estimated jointly. It also accounts for the unobserved heterogeneity among borrowers, and estimates the unobserved heterogeneity simultaneously with the parameters and baseline hazards associated with prepayment and default functions. Our results show that the option model, in its most straightforward version, does a good job of explaining default and prepayment, but it is not enough by itself. The simultaneity of the options is very important empirically in explaining behavior. The results also show that there exists significant heterogeneity among mortgage borrowers. Ignoring this heterogeneity results in serious errors in estimating the prepayment behavior of homeowners.","Yongheng Deng, John M. Quigley and Robert van Order",Yongheng Deng,John M.

A strong ""independence of procedures"" result is derived: after initial postures have been adopted, the bargaining outcome is independent of the fine details of the bargaining protocol so long as both players have the opportunity to make offers frequently. The latter analysis yields a unique continuous-time limit with a war of attrition structure. In the continuous-time game, equilibrium is unique, and entails delay, consequently inefficiency. The equilibrium outcome reflects the combined influence of the rates of time preference of the players and the ex ante probabilities of different irrational types. As the probability of irrationality goes to zero, delay and inefficiency disappear; furthermore, if there is a rich set of types for both agents, the limit equilibrium payoffs are inversely proportional to their rates of time preference.",Dilip Abreu and Faruk Gul,Dilip Abreu,Faruk Gul,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Because classical confidence regions also present conceptual and computational problems in multivariate time series models, we suggest that likelihood-based bands, rather than approximate confidence bands based on asymptotic theory, be standard in reporting results for this type of model.",Christopher A.

We do not assume that the decision maker has complete structural knowledge of the environment. Instead the agent knows the set of actions he can take, he formulates preferences directly on the actions, and chooses according to these preferences. On the basis of experience he modifies these preferences according to a systematic procedure. Our axioms are imposed on this procedure, rather than directly on the choice itself. The axioms consist of a group of natural structural restrictions and a group of independence axioms.

In contrast, super-experienced bidders, who have largely overcome the winner's curse, satisfy the comparative static predictions of equilibrium bidding theory: (i) average seller's revenue is larger with an insider than in SIS auctions, (ii) insiders make substantially greater profits, conditional on winning, than outsiders, and (iii) insiders increase their bids in response to more rivals.

The model has appealing aggregation properties, and yields nonlinear aggregate time series processes. The passivity of normal times is, occasionally, more than offset by the brisk response to large accumulated shocks.

A key feature is a parameter δ that weights the strength of hypothetical reinforcement of strategies that were not chosen according to the payoff they would have yielded, relative to reinforcement of chosen strategies according to received payoffs. The other key features are two discount rates, φ and ρ, which separately discount previous attractions, and an experience weight. EWA includes reinforcement learning and weighted fictitious play (belief learning) as special cases, and hybridizes their key elements. When δ = 0 and ρ = 0, cumulative choice reinforcement results. When δ = 1 and ρ = φ, levels of reinforcement of strategies are exactly the same as expected payoffs given weighted fictitious play beliefs. Using three sets of experimental data, parameter estimates of the model were calibrated on part of the data and used to predict a holdout sample. Estimates of δ are generally around .50, φ around .8-1, and ρ varies from 0 to φ. Reinforcement and belief-learning special cases are generally rejected in favor of EWA, though belief models do better in some constant-sum games. EWA is able to combine the best features of previous approaches, allowing attractions to begin and grow flexibly as choice reinforcement does, but reinforcing unchosen strategies substantially as belief-based models implicitly do.",Colin Camerer and Teck-Hua Ho,Colin Camerer,Teck-Hua Ho,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

At the level of the individual, we find that person effects, especially those not related to observables like education, are a very important source of wage variation in France. Firm effects, while important, are not as important as person effects. At the level of firms, we find that enterprises that hire high-wage workers are more productive but not more profitable. They are also more capital and high-skilled employee intensive. Enterprises that pay higher wages, controlling for person effects, are more productive and more profitable. They are also more capital intensive but are not more high-skilled labor intensive.

In the model presented below, the balanced growth path is unstable and the economy achieves sustainable growth through cycles under an empirically plausible condition, perpetually moving back and forth between two phases. One phase is characterized by higher output growth, higher investment, no innovation, and a competitive market structure. The other phase is characterized by lower output growth, lower investment, high innovation, and a more monopolistic market structure. Both investment and innovation are essential in sustaining growth indefinitely, and yet they move in an asynchronized way; only one of them appears to play a dominant role in each phase.

To give parties a choice over a domain that contains both progressive and regressive income tax policies requires an issue space that is at least two-dimensional. Nash equilibrium in pure strategies of the standard two-party game, whose players have complete preferences over a two-dimensional policy space, generically fails to exist. I introduce a new equilibrium concept for political games, based on the fact of factional conflict within parties. Each party is supposed to consist of reformists, militants, and opportunists: each faction has a complete preference order on policy space, but together they can only agree on a partial order. Nash equilibria of the two-party game, where the policy space consists of all quadratic income tax functions, and each party is represented by its partial order, exist, and it is shown that, in such equilibria, both parties propose progressive income taxation.",John E.

At the time the security is issued, the issuer's or underwriter's private information regarding the payoff of the security may cause illiquidity, in the form of a downward-sloping demand curve for the security. The severity of this illiquidity depends upon the sensitivity of the value of the issued security to the issuer's private information. Thus, the security-design problem involves a tradeoff between the retention cost of holding cash flows not included in the security design, and the liquidity cost of including the cash flows and making the security design more sensitive to the issuer's private information. We characterize the optimal security design in several cases.

This paper explores what the theory of individuals implies for households that have more than one member. We make minimal assumptions about how the individual members of the household resolve conflicts. All we assume is that however decisions are made, outcomes are efficient. We refer to this as the collective setting. We show that in the collective setting household demands must satisfy a symmetry and rank condition on the Slutsky matrix. We also present some further results on the effects on demands of variables that do not modify preferences but that do affect how decisions are made. We apply our theory to a series of surveys of household expenditures from Canada. The tests of the usual symmetry conditions are rejected for two-person households but not for one-person households. We also show that income pooling is rejected for two-person households. We then test for our collective setting conditions on the couples data. None of the collective setting restrictions are rejected. We conclude that the collective setting is a plausible and tractable next step to take in the analysis of household behavior.",M.

We take an implementation approach, characterizing the possible allocation rules which result as the extensive game form is varied. We are particularly concerned with the impact of making trade voluntary: imposing individual rationality on and off the equilibrium path. No buyer or seller consumates an agreement which leaves them worse off than the discounted expected value of their future rematching in the market.

Recently, Lütkepohl (1993) proposed to define noncausality between two variables in terms of nonpredictibility at any number of periods ahead. When more than two vectors are considered (i.e., when the information set contains auxiliary variables), these two notions are not equivalent. In this paper, we first generalize the notion of causality by considering causality at a given (arbitrary) horizon h. Then we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for noncausality between vectors of variables (inside a larger vector) up to any given horizon h, where h can be infinite. In particular, for general possibly nonstationary processes with finite second moments, relatively simple exhaustivity and separation conditions, which are sufficient for noncausality at all horizons, are provided. To deal with cases where such conditions do not apply, we consider a more specific, although still very wide, class of vector autoregressive processes (possibly of infinite order, stationary or nonstationary), which include multivariate ARIMA processes, and we derive general parametric characterizations of noncausality at various horizons for this class (including a causality chain characterization). We also observe that the coefficients of lagged variables in forecasts at various horizons h ≥ 1 can be interpreted as generalized impulse response coefficients which yield a complete picture of linear causality properties, in contrast with usual response coefficients which can be quite misleading in this respect.",Jean-Marie Dufour and Eric Renault,Jean-Marie Dufour,Eric Renault,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The conditional intensity is developed and compared with other self-exciting processes. Because the model focuses on the expected duration between events, it is called the autoregressive conditional duration (ACD) model. Asymptotic properties of the quasi maximum likelihood estimator are developed as a corollary to ARCH model results. Strong evidence is provided for duration clustering for the financial transaction data analyzed; both deterministic time-of-day effects and stochastic effects are important. The model is applied to the arrival times of trades and therefore is a model of transaction volume, and also to the arrival of other events such as price changes. Models for the volatility of prices are estimated with price-based durations, and examined from a market microstructure point of view.",Robert F. Engle and Jeffrey R. Russell,Robert F.

We find that the distributions of job and unemployment spells are consistent with the data, and that the qualitative predictions of the model for the wages set by employers are confirmed by wage regressions. The model is estimated using panel data on unemployed and employed individuals.

It is shown that if agents are somewhat uncertain about the local stability of the system, and are accordingly ready to extrapolate a large range of regularities (trends) that may show up in past small deviations from equilibrium, including divergent ones, the learning dynamics is locally divergent. On the other hand, if agents are fairly sure of the local stability of the system, and extrapolate only convergent trends out of small past deviations from equilibrium, one may get local stability.

We establish that bunching is robust in these multidimensional screening problems, even with very regular distributions of types. This comes from a strong conflict between participation constraints and second order incentive compatibility conditions. We consequently design a new technique, the sweeping procedure, for dealing with bunching in multidimensional contexts. This technique extends the ironing procedure of Mussa and Rosen (1978) to several dimensions. We illustrate it on two examples: we first solve a linear quadratic version of the bidimensional nonlinear pricing problem, where consumers' types are exponentially distributed. The solution involves pure bundling for consumers with low demands. The second example is the bidimensional version of the Mussa and Rosen problem when consumers' types are uniformly distributed on a square. The solution is such that the seller offers a full differentiation of products in the upper part of the qualities spectrum, but only limited choice for lower qualities. This seems to be a quite general pattern for multidimensional screening problems.

Consistent with prior results, changes in stakes had only a small effect on play for inexperienced players. But the present experimental design allows us to observe that rejections were less frequent the higher the stakes, and proposals in the high stakes conditions declined slowly as subjects gained experience. This Slovak experiment is the first to detect a lower frequency of rejection when stakes are higher and this can be explained by the added power due to multiple observations per subject in the experimental design.

Providing incentives for players to reveal their observations generates (revelation) constraints that, combined with signal imperfections, may be a source of inefficiencies. However, by delaying the revelation of their observations, players may economize on the cost of deterring deviations, and thereby avoid these inefficiencies. Because a player would not want to trigger a sanction that would penalize him too, revelation constraints also tend to make sanctions difficult to enforce. However, with at least three players, detecting deviations may not require that all the players reveal their observations. In that case, we obtain a Nash threat version of the Folk theorem.

In a differentiated product market, a firm cannot directly observe rival firms' secret price cutting, but its own sales can imperfectly indicate what is going on. Since the firms' sales levels are subject to random shocks, they may well end up having diverse expectations: firms with low sales may suspect price cutting while others may not. This causes a serious difficulty in sustaining collusion in such a market. In fact, the characterization of equilibria of this class of games-discounted repeated games where each player receives a different signal-has been an open question, despite the large body of literature on repeated games. The present paper shows that communication is a powerful way of resolving the possible confusion among the players in this class of games.

The effects of military service are difficult to measure because veterans are both self-selected and screened by the military. This study uses two strategies to reduce selection bias in estimates of the effects of military service on the earnings of veterans. Both approaches involve the analysis of a special match of Social Security earning records to administrative data on applicants to the armed forces. The first strategy compares applicants who enlisted with applicants who did not enlist, while controlling for most of the characteristics used by the military to select soldiers from the applicant pool. This is implemented using matching methods and regression. The second strategy uses instrumental variables that were generated by an error in the scoring of the exams that screen military applicants. Estimates from both strategies are interpreted using models with heterogeneous potential outcomes. The empirical results suggest that soldiers who served in the early 1980s were paid considerably more than comparable civilians while in the military, and that military service is associated with higher employment rates for veterans after service. In spite of this employment gain, however, military service led to only a modest long-run increase in the civilian earnings of nonwhite veterans while actually reducing the civilian earnings of white veterans.",Joshua D.

These papers emphasized methods that correspond to using Owen's (1988) method of empirical likelihood to reweight the data so that the reweighted sample obeys all the moment restrictions at the parameter estimates. In this paper we consider an alternative KLIC motivated weighting and show how it and similar discrete reweightings define a class of unconstrained optimization problems which includes GMM as a special case. Such KLIC-motivated reweightings introduce M auxiliary ""tilting"" parameters, where M is the number of moments; parameter and overidentification hypotheses can be recast in terms of these tilting parameters. Such tests are often startlingly more effective than their conventional counterparts. These differences are not completely explained by differences in the leading terms of the asymptotic expansions of the test statistics.","Guido W. Imbens, Richard H.

In this paper we provide a set of conditions by which we can relatively easily prove the asymptotic posterior normality under quite general situations of possible nonstationarity. This result reinforces and generalizes the point of Sims and Uhlig (1991) that inference based on the likelihood principle, explained by Berger and Wolpert (1988), will be unchanged regardless of whether the data are generated by a stationary process or by a unit root process. On the other hand, our conditions allow us to generalize the Bayesian information criterion known as the Schwarz criterion to the case of possible nonstationarity.

Given that disagreements between subject evaluation and evaluation done by investigators could be due to sampling error, this paper provides an empirical framework for estimating the systematic level of disagreement in the presence of such errors.

We consider the general case of a partial structural change model where not all parameters are subject to shifts. We study both fixed and shrinking magnitudes of shifts and obtain the rates of convergence for the estimated break fractions. We also propose a procedure that allows one to test the null hypothesis of, say, l changes, versus the alternative hypothesis of l + 1 changes. This is particularly useful in that it allows a specific to general modeling strategy to consistently determine the appropriate number of changes present.

The tests are valid for I(0) and I(1) errors. Trend functions that are permitted include general linear polynomial trend functions that may have breaks at either known or unknown locations. Asymptotic distributions are derived, and consistency of the tests is established. The general results are applied to a model with a simple linear trend. A local asymptotic analysis is used to compute asymptotic size and power of the tests for this example. Size is well controlled and is relatively unaffected by the variance of the initial condition. Asymptotic power curves are computed for the simple linear trend model and are compared to existing tests. It is shown that the new tests have nontrivial asymptotic power.

A Nash equilibrium of a complete information game is said to be robust to incomplete information if every incomplete information game with payoffs almost always given by the complete information game has an equilibrium which generates behavior close to the Nash equilibrium. We show that many games with strict equilibria have no robust equilibrium and examine why we get such different results from existing refinements.

This paper investigates what may be learned about treatment response when it is assumed that response functions are monotone, semi-monotone, or concave-monotone. The analysis assumes nothing about the process of treatment selection and imposes no cross-individual restrictions on response. The basic idea is to determine, for every member of the population, the set of response functions that pass through that person's realized (treatment, outcome) pair and that are consistent with the functional-form assumption imposed. These person-specific findings are then explicitly aggregated across the population to determine what can be learned about the distribution of response.

Two types of inference problems are studied: (i) inference about parameters which are not identifiable on certain subsets of the parameter space, and (ii) inference about parameter transformations with discontinuities. When a LAU parameter or parametric function has an unbounded range, it is shown under general regularity conditions that any valid confidence set with level 1 - α for this parameter must be unbounded with probability close to 1 - α in the neighborhood of nonidentification subsets and will have a nonzero probability of being unbounded under any distribution compatible with the model: no valid confidence set which is almost surely bounded does exist. These properties hold even if ""identifying restrictions"" are imposed. Similar results also obtain for parameters with bounded ranges. Consequently, a confidence set which does not satisfy this characterization has zero coverage probability (level). This will be the case in particular for Wald-type confidence intervals based on asymptotic standard errors. Furthermore, Wald-type statistics for testing given values of a LAU parameter cannot be pivotal functions (i.e., they have distributions which depend on unknown nuisance parameters) and even cannot be usefully bounded over the space of the nuisance parameters. These results are applied to several econometric problems: inference in simultaneous equations (instrumental variables (IV) regressions), linear regressions with autoregressive errors, inference about long-run multipliers and cointegrating vectors. For example, it is shown that standard ""asymptotically justified"" confidence intervals based on IV estimators (such as two-stage least squares) and the associated ""standard errors"" have zero coverage probability, and the corresponding t statistics have distributions which cannot be bounded by any finite set of distribution functions, a result of interest for interpreting IV regressions with ""weak instruments."" Furthermore, expansion methods (e.g., Edgeworth expansions) and bootstrap techniques cannot solve these difficulties. Finally, in a number of cases where Wald-type methods are fundamentally flawed (e.g., IV regressions with poor instruments), it is observed that likelihood-based methods (e.g., likelihood-ratio tests and confidence sets) combined with projection techniques can easily yield valid tests and confidence sets.",Jean-Marie Dufour,Jean-Marie Dufour,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

In the model, researchers sample from probability distributions of potential new production techniques. Past research generates a technological frontier representing the best techniques for producing each good in the economy. Technological breakthroughs, resulting in patents, become increasingly hard to find as the technological frontier advances. This explains why patenting has been roughly constant as research employment has risen sharply over the last forty years. Productivity is determined by the position of the technological frontier and hence by the stock of past research. If researchers sample from Pareto distributions, then productivity growth is proportional to the growth of the research stock. The Pareto specification accounts for why productivity growth has neither risen as research employment has grown nor fallen as patenting has failed to grow. The growth of research employment itself is driven, in equilibrium, by population growth.

Nevertheless, elections fully aggregate information in the sense that the chosen candidate would not change if all private information were common knowledge. Equilibrium voting behavior is to a large extent determined by the electoral rule, i.e., if a candidate is required to get at least x percent of the vote in order to win the election, then in equilibrium this candidate gets very close to x percent of the vote with probability close to one.

Agents adapt their beliefs over time by choosing from a finite set of different predictor or expectations functions. Each predictor is a function of past observations and has a performance or fitness measure which is publicly available. Agents make a rational choice concerning the predictors based upon their past performance. This results in a dynamics across predictor choice which is coupled to the equilibrium dynamics of the endogenous variables. As a simple, but typical, example we consider a cobweb type demand-supply model where agents can choose between rational and naive expectations. In an unstable market with (small) positive information costs for rational expectations, a high intensity of choice to switch predictors leads to highly irregular equilibrium prices converging to a strange attractor. The irregularity of the equilibrium time paths is explained by the existence of a so-called homoclinic orbit and its associated complicated dynamical phenomena. Thus local instability and global complicated dynamics may be a feature of a fully rational notion of equilibrium.",William A. Brock and Cars H. Hommes,William A. Brock,Cars H.

Furthermore, under the assumption of normal errors the ICM test is asymptotically admissible, in the sense that there does not exist a test that is uniformly more powerful.

This can guarantee the more patient player (in any Nash equilibrium) a payoff close to the highest feasible payoff consistent with the individual rationality of the other player. For an arbitrary degree of patience of the less patient player a weaker result is established: the more patient player is guaranteed an average equilibrium payoff close to the static Stackelberg payoff.

We estimate a dynamic programming (DP) model of the joint labor supply and Social Security acceptance decision, focusing on a sample of males in the low to middle income brackets whose only pension is Social Security. The DP model delivers a rich set of predictions about the dynamics of retirement behavior, and comparisons of actual vs. predicted behavior show that the DP model is able to account for a wide variety of phenomena observed in the data, including the pronounced peaks in the distribution of retirement ages at 62 and 65 (the ages of early and normal eligibility for Social Security benefits, respectively). We identify a significant fraction of ""health insurance constrained"" individuals who have no form of retiree health insurance other than Medicare, and who can only obtain fairly priced private health insurance via their employer's group health plan. The combination of significant individual risk aversion and a long tailed (Pareto) distribution of health care expenditures implies that there is a significant ""security value"" for these individuals to remain employed until they are eligible for Medicare coverage at age 65. Overall, our model suggests that a number of heretofore puzzling aspects of retirement behavior can be viewed as artifacts of particular details of the Social Security rules, whose incentive effects are especially strong for lower income individuals and those who do not have access to fairly priced loans, annuities, and health insurance.",John Rust and Christopher Phelan,John Rust,Christopher Phelan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

It is hypothesized that these behavioral responses contribute to the enforcement of contracts and, hence, increase gains from trade. It turns out that if only one side of the market has opportunities for reciprocal responses, the impact of reciprocity on contract enforcement depends on the details of the pecuniary incentive system. If both sides of the market have opportunities for reciprocal responses, robust and powerful reciprocity effects occur. In particular, reciprocal behavior causes a substantial increase in the set of enforceable actions and, hence, large efficiency gains.","Ernst Fehr, Simon Gächter and Georg Kirchsteiger",Ernst Fehr,Simon Gächter,Georg Kirchsteiger,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

To compute such an estimator, however, can be problematic because of the difficulty of global optimization. In consequence, practitioners usually ignore the problem and take the GMM estimator to be the result of a local optimization algorithm. This yields an estimator that is not necessarily consistent and asymptotically normal. The use of a local optimization algorithm also can run into the problem of instability due to flats or ridges in the criterion function, which makes it difficult to know when to stop the algorithm. To alleviate these problems of global and local optimization, we propose a stopping-rule (SR) procedure for computing GMM estimators. The SR procedure eliminates the need for global search with high probability. And, it provides an explicit SR for problems of stability that may arise with local optimization problems.",Donald W. K.

The present paper examines this basic test of perfect competition in economies with an infinite dimensional space of commodities and a large finite number of agents. In this context, we cannot expect equality of the core and the set of Walrasian allocations; rather, as in the finite dimensional context, we look for theorems establishing core convergence (that is, approximate decentralization of core allocations in economies with a large finite number of agents). Previous work in this area has established that core convergence for replica economies and core equivalence for economies with a continuum of agents continue to be valid in the infinite dimensional context under assumptions much the same as those needed in the finite dimensional context. For general large finite economies, however, we present here a sequence of examples of failure of core convergence. These examples point to a serious disconnection between replica economies and continuum economies on the one hand, and general large finite economies on the other hand. We identify the source of this disconnection as the measurability requirements that are implicit in the continuum model, and which correspond to compactness requirements that have especially serious economic content in the infinite dimensional context. We also obtain a positive result. When the commodity space is L^1, the space of integrable functions on a finite measure space, we establish core convergence under the assumptions that marginal utility goes to zero as consumption tends to infinity and the per capita social endowment lies above a consumption bundle which is equidesirable with respect to the preferences.

One would thus have constructed a theory in which Nash equilibrium behavior is a necessary long-run consequence of optimization by cautious players.

Bids and asks tend to reveal more of the underlying values and costs than predicted, particularly when subjects are experienced.

Firms' choices on whether to liquidate, and on input quantities should they continue, depended on their productivity. This generates a selection and a simultaneity problem when estimating production functions. Our theoretical focus is on providing an estimation algorithm which takes explicit account of these issues. We find that our algorithm produces markedly different and more plausible estimates of production function coefficients than do traditional estimation procedures. Using our estimates we find increases in the rate of aggregate productivity growth after deregulation.

The prospect of a productivity drop may prevent the agent from climbing the technological ladder as quickly as he might. Indeed, an agent may be so skilled at some technology that he will never switch again, so that he will experience no long-run growth.

This excludes not only adverse selection problems, but also moral hazards problems in which hidden actions generate private information over the future. In this paper we show, in the context of a multiperiod principal-agent relationship with adverse selection, that renegotiable short-term contracts can be as efficient as long-term renegotiation-proof contracts. On the other hand, spot contracting may fail to achieve long-run efficiency not only because of intertemporal smoothing, as with symmetric information, but also because of ratchet effects and time inconsistency in the optimal structure of informational rents. Thus some limited commitment seems to be a necessary and sufficient condition to achieve long-run efficiency.",Patrick Rey and Bernard Salanié,Patrick Rey,Bernard Salanié,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

One reason for this generalization is to avoid the perhaps unrealistic constraint--inherent to noncooperative games--that the set of strategy tuples must be a Cartesian product of the strategy sets of the players. Another reason is that in most economic and social activities (e.g., in sequential bargaining without a rigid protocol) the ""rules of the game"" are rather amorphous; the procedures are rarely pinned down. Such social environments can, however, be represented as multistage situations and be effectively analyzed through the theory of social situations. The paper contributes to the theory of social situations within the framework of multistage situations (e.g., the existence of a largest conservative stable standard of behavior which yields a definition that extends ""subgame perfect equilibrium paths""), and to the theory of multistage games (e.g., the existence of ε-generalized perfect equilibrium, for all ε > 0). It also provides an equivalence theorem between subgame perfection and the largest conservative stable standard of behavior for multistage games. The usefulness of our approach is further illustrated by our notion of ""k-rationality"" whereby (at each substitution) players look only k steps ahead.","Joseph Greenberg, Dov Monderer and Benyamin Shitovitz",Joseph Greenberg,Dov Monderer,Benyamin Shitovitz,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

It is shown that small transaction costs can greatly reduce the required variability of IMRSs. This suggests that the low variability of many parametric, aggregate consumption based IMRSs need not be inconsistent with asset return data. Euler inequalities for a transaction cost economy with power utility are tested using aggregate consumption data and returns on stocks and short maturity U.S. Treasury bills. In the majority of cases there is little evidence against power utility specifications with low risk-aversion parameters. The results are obtained with transaction costs on stocks as small as .5% of price, and are in sharp contrast to the strong rejection of the analogous Euler equalities for a frictionless economy.",Erzo G.

The procedure provides a visually clear representation of where in the density of wages these various factors exert the greatest impact. Using data from the Current Population Survey, we find, as in previous research, that de-unionization and supply and demand shocks were important factors in explaining the rise in wage inequality from 1979 to 1988. We find also compelling visual and quantitative evidence that the decline in the real value of the minimum wage explains a substantial proportion of this increase in wage inequality, particularly for women. We conclude that labor market institutions are as important as supply and demand considerations in explaining changes in the U.S. distribution of wages from 1979 to 1988.","John DiNardo, Nicole M.

This concept is called risk vulnerability. It is equivalent to the condition that an undesirable risk can never be made desirable by the presence of an independent, unfair risk. Moreover, under risk vulnerability, adding an unfair background risk reduces the demand for risky assets. Risk vulnerability generalizes the concept of properness (individually undesirable, independent risks are always jointly undesirable) introduced by Pratt and Zeckhauser (1987). It implies that the two first derivatives of the utility function are concave transformations of the original utility function. Under decreasing absolute risk aversion, a sufficient condition for risk vulnerability is local properness, i.e. r"" ≥ r'r, where r is the Arrow-Pratt coefficient of absolute risk aversion.",Christian Gollier and John W.

For exogeneously given prices the buyer's problem is a multi-armed bandit problem. The innovation in this paper is to endogenize the cost of experimentation to the consumer by allowing for price competition between the sellers. The role of prices is then to allocate intertemporally the costs and benefits of learning between buyers and sellers. We examine how strategic aspects of the oligopoly model interact with the learning process. All Markov perfect equilibria (MPE) are efficient. We identify an equilibrium which besides its unique robustness properties has a strikingly simple, seemingly myopic pricing rule. Prices below marginal cost emerge naturally to sustain experimentation. Intertemporal exchange of the gains of learning is necessary to support efficient experimentation.

The tests are obtained by comparing a kernel-based normalized spectral density estimator and the null normalized spectral density estimator and the null normalized spectral density, using a quadratic norm, the Hellinger metric, and the Kullback-Leibler information criterion respectively. Under the null hypothesis of no serial correlation, the three classes of new test statistics are asymptotically N(0, 1) and equivalent. The null distributions are obtained without having to specify any alternative model. Unlike some conventional tests for serial correlation, the null distributions of our tests remain invariant when the regressors include lagged dependent variables. Under a suitable class of local alternatives, the three classes of the new tests are asymptotically equally efficient. Under global alternatives, however, their relative efficiencies depend on the relative magnitudes of the three divergence measures. Our approach provides an interpretation for Box and Pierce's (1970) test, which can be viewed as a quadratic norm based test using a truncated periodogram. Many kernels deliver tests with better power than Box and Pierce's test or the truncated kernel based test. A simulation study shows that the new tests have good power against an AR(1) process and a fractionally integrated process. In particular, they have better power than the Lagrange multiplier tests of Breusch (1978) and Godfrey (1978) as well as the portmanteau tests of Box and Pierce (1970) and Ljung and Box (1978). The cross-validation procedure of Beltrao and Bloomfield (1987) and Robinson (1991a) works reasonably well in determining the smoothing parameter of the kernel spectral estimator and is recommended for use in practice.",Yongmiao Hong,Yongmiao Hong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Market uncertainty is specified in such a way that general types of individual risk and collective risk are properly accounted for and so that, specifically, market clearing is always satisfied ex post as well as ex ante. We show that consistency of beliefs and optimality of allocation can be guaranteed with an appropriate array of pure Arrow securities to spread collective risk and mutual insurance policies to pool individual risk. When there is individual risk common to like groups of individuals, pooling risk by means of mutual insurance permits substantial economizing on market transactions, as compared to those required if dealing instead with the full complement of pure Arrow securities. We show that if there are N households (consisting of H types), each facing the possibility of being in S individual states together with T collective states, then ensuring Pareto optimally requires only H(S - 1)T independent mutual insurance policies plus T pure Arrow securities. Our results also help to clarify the question of which missing markets may affect allocational efficiency.","David Cass, Graciela Chichilnisky and Ho-Mou Wu",David Cass,Graciela Chichilnisky,Ho-Mou Wu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

From the embedding we obtain a large sample approximation to the model of the data that corresponds to the exponential density. This has the form of discrete observations drawn from a nonlinear stochastic differential equation driven by Brownian motion.

Our model is an exchange economy with a finite set of commodities, a market maker who adjusts prices, a large finite set of agents who trade only with the market maker, and a parameter λ ∈ (0, 1) which determines the rate of price adjustment. Each agent has an initial endowment and a preference relation. At each discrete time, one agent is chosen at random and makes the trade which maximizes his preferences subject to the budget constraint at the current price vector. Then the market maker adjusts the price vector according to the following rule: if x is the change in the commodity vector of the agent who just traded, p is the old price, and α is the number of agents, then the new price is p + (α<sup>-λ</sup>)x. Thus both the price vector and the commodity allocation change randomly with time. We obtain asymptotic results as the number of agents goes to infinity, subject to stability assumptions on the price paths. It was shown in the earlier paper that with probability arbitrarily close to one the price path in our model will approximate the price path of the corresponding tatonnement process on a rapid time scale, and will then remain close to a limit price. In this paper we show that, with probability arbitrarily close to one, the economy will approach a competitive equilibrium, and the process will be feasible in the sense that the market maker's inventory is approximately constant over time. Our main assumption is that the price adjustment rule is stable throughout the trading process. This is stronger than the classical tatonnement assumption that the price adjustment rule is stable at the initial endowment. We show that many classical examples of exchange economies satisfy our assumptions, and then give an example where stability at the initial endowment holds but the stronger stability assumption needed for our results fails.",H.

Another model--GARCH--amounts to a one-sided weighted rolling regression. We develop continuous record asymptotic approximations for the measurement error in conditional variances and covariances when using these methods. We derive asymptotically optimal window lengths for standard rolling regressions and optimal weights for weighted rolling regressions.

We analyze an oligopoly model with price competition and free entry, taking explicit account of the integer constraint. Under the Chamberlinian symmetry assumption (that tastes are i.i.d.), we first show that logconcavity of the taste density implies there is excessive market provision of variety when each consumer buys one unit of the product from one of the firms. We then show that this result extends to price-sensitive individual demands by proving that the equilibrium number of firms is at least as great as that which would be provided at the second-best social optimum subject to a zero-profit constraint for firms. Our results call into question previous findings for representative consumer models that left open the possibility of insufficient product diversity.","Simon P.

The method modifies least squares to account for serial correlation effects and for the endogeneity in the regressors that results from the existence of a cointegrating relationship. This paper provides a general framework which makes it possible to study the asymptotic behavior of FM-OLS in models with full rank I(1) regressors, models with I(1) and I(0) regressors, models with unit roots, and models with only stationary regressors. This framework enables us to consider the use of FM regression in the context of vector autoregressions (VAR's) with some unit roots and some cointegrating relations. The resulting FM-VAR regressions are shown to have some interesting properties. For example, when there is some cointegration in the system, FM-VAR estimation has a limit theory that is normal for all of the stationary coefficients and mixed normal for all of the nonstationary coefficients. Thus, there are no unit root limit distributions even in the case of the unit root coefficient submatrix (i.e., I<sub>n - r</sub>, for an n-dimensional VAR with r cointegrating vectors). Moreover, optimal estimation of the cointegration space is attained in FM-VAR regression without prior knowledge of the number of unit roots in the system, without pretesting to determine the dimension of the cointegration space and without the use of restricted regression techniques like reduced rank regression. The paper also develops an asymptotic theory for inference based on FM-OLS and FM-VAR regression. The limit theory for Wald tests that rely on the FM estimator is shown to involve a linear combination of independent chi-squared variates. This limit distribution is bounded above by the conventional chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of restrictions. Thus, conventional critical values can be used to construct valid (but conservative) asymptotic tests in quite general FM time series regressions. This theory applies to causality testing in VAR's and is therefore potentially useful in empirical applications.",Peter C. B. Phillips,Peter C. B. Phillips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The new test statistics converge in distribution to a unit normal under correct specification and grow to infinity faster than the parametric rate (n<sup>-1/2</sup>) under misspecification, while avoiding weighting, sample splitting, and non-nested testing procedures used elsewhere in the literature. Asymptotically, our tests can be viewed as a test of the joint hypothesis that the true parameters of a series regression model are zero, where the dependent variable is the residual from the parametric model, and the series terms are functions of the explanatory variables, chosen so as to support nonparametric estimation of a conditional expectation. We specifically consider Fourier series and regression splines, and present a Monte Carlo study of the finite sample performance of the new tests in comparison to consistent tests of Bierens (1990), Eubank and Spiegelman (1990), Jayasuriya (1990), Wooldridge (1992), and Yatchew (1992); the results show the new tests have good power, performing quite well in some situations.

As an application, the theory is used to develop a new model of large games which emphasizes the explicit description of the players' randominizations. This model is used to study the class of environments in which Schmeidler's (1973) representation of strategic uncertainty in large games is valid.",Nabil Ibraheem Al-Najjar,Nabil Ibraheem Al-Najjar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

I argue that aggregate information is therefore not very important for individual consumption decisions and study models of life-cycle consumption in which individuals react optimally to their own income process but have incomplete or no information on economy-wide variables. Since individual income is less persistent than aggregate income consumers will react too little to aggregate income variation. Aggregate consumption will be excessively smooth. Since aggregate information is slowly incorporated into consumption, aggregate consumption will be autocorrelated and correlated with lagged income. On the other hand, the model has the same prediction for micro data as the standard permanent income model. The second part of the paper provides empirical evidence on individual and aggregate income processes. Different models for individual income are fit to quarterly data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation making various adjustments for measurement error.

Specifically, the method relies on a simulated nonlinear least squares objective function appropriately adjusted so as to obtain consistent estimates of the parameters of interest. We illustrate the proposed method by studying a market of agricultural products, where descending auctions are used. Our analysis takes into account heterogeneity of the auctioned objects and the fact that only the winning bid is observed.

In 1983, the federal government replaced its previous cost-based reimbursement method with a Prospective Payment System, under which reimbursement depends only on the diagnosis of the patient. Hospitals thus lost the marginal reimbursement they formerly received for providing additional treatments. In addition, the average price each hospital received for patients with different diagnoses changed. This paper relates each of these changes to adverse outcomes, with two conclusions. First, there is a change in the timing of deaths associated with changes in average prices. In hospitals with price declines, a greater share of deaths occur in the hospital or shortly after discharge, but by one year post-discharge, mortality is no higher. Second, there is a trend increase in readmission rates caused by the elimination of marginal reimbursement.

This criterion applies to many-action games, not merely 2 × 2 games.

We develop a maximum-likelihood estimation method which uses all the information in the data, creates test statistics that can be aggregated across studies, and enables one to judge the predictive utility--the fit and parsimony--of utility theories. Analyses of 23 data sets, using several thousand choices, suggest a menu of theories which sacrifice the least parsimony for the biggest improvement in fit. The menu is: mixed fanning, prospect theory, EU, and expected value. Which theories are best is highly sensitive to whether gambles in a pair have the same support (EU fits better) or not (EU fits poorly).

This paper explores the structure of no trade theorems with heterogeneous prior beliefs. It is shown how different notions of efficiency under asymmetric information--ex ante, interim, ex post--are related to agents' prior beliefs, as well as incentive compatible and public versions of those efficiency concepts. These efficiency results are used to characterize necessary and sufficient conditions on agents' beliefs for no trade theorems in different trading environments.",Stephen Morris,Stephen Morris,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

A particularly important feature of this formula is a way of accounting for the presence of nonparametric estimates of nuisance functions. The general form of an adjustment factor for nonparametric estimates is derived and analyzed. The usefulness of the formula is illustrated by deriving propositions on invariance of the limiting distribution with respect to the nonparametric estimator, conditions for nonparametric estimation to have no effect on the asymptotic distribution, and the form of a correction term for the presence of nonparametric projection and density estimators. Examples discussed are quasi-maximum likelihood estimation of index models, panel probit with semiparametric individual effects, average derivatives, and inverse density weighted least squares. The paper also develops a set of regularity conditions for the validity of the asymptotic variance formula. Primitive regularity conditions are derived for <tex-math>$\sqrt{n}\text{-consistency}$</tex-math> and asymptotic normality for functions of series estimators of projections. Specific examples are polynomial estimators of average derivative and semiparametric panel probit models.",Whitney K. Newey,Whitney K. Newey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

For example, the results apply to tests of one-time structural change with unknown change-point. Several other examples are discussed in the paper. The results of the paper are of interest, because the testing problem considered is nonstandard and the classical asymptotic optimality results for the Lagrange multiplier (LM), Wald, and likelihood ratio (LR) tests do not apply. A weighted average power criterion is used here to generate optimal tests. This criterion is similar to that used by Wald (1943) to obtain the classical asymptotic optimality properties of Wald tests in ""regular"" testing problems. In fact, the optimal tests introduced here reduce to the standard LM, Wald, and LR tests when standard regularity conditions hold. Nevertheless, in the nonstandard cases of main interest, new optimal tests are obtained and the LR test is not found to be an optimal test.",Donald W. K. Andrews and Werner Ploberger,Donald W. K.

Our model assumes the object to be sold has an unknown common value, but one buyer has better information than the others. We permit the reservation price to be correlated with the information of the informed buyer, which reflects both his assessment of the value of the object and the probability of rejection at any bid. Assuming all random variables are affiliated, we establish the following results. (i) The percentage rate of increase in the distribution of the uninformed bid is never greater than the percentage rate of increase of the distribution of the informed bid. (ii) The distributions are identical at bids above the support of the reservation price. (iii) The informed buyer is more likely to submit low bids.

Each player's payoff depends only on his own action and the state of nature. However, because a player's action reveals his private information, players wait to see what other players will do. Equilibrium is inefficient because delay is costly and information is imperfectly revealed. We characterize the unique symmetric perfect Bayesian equilibrium and study the robustness of delay, which turns out to be sensitive to the reaction speed and the number of players. We establish the following results. (i) When the period length is very short, the game ends very quickly and there is a form of herding or informational cascade which results in a collapse of investment. (ii) As the period length increases, the possibility of herding disappears. (iii) As the number of players increases, the rate of investment and the information flow are eventually independent of the number of players; adding more players simply increases the number who delay.

A unique and symmetric Markov perfect equilibrium is characterized, and two concepts of self-reinforcing market dominance investigated. One is increasing dominance (ID), whereby the leading firm has a greater probability of winning the next sale; the other is increasing increasing dominance (IID), whereby a firm's probability of winning the next sale increases with the length of its lead. Sufficient conditions for IID (and thus for ID) are that the discount factor is sufficiently low or sufficiently high. Other sufficient conditions for ID and IID are given in the case of two-step learning, in which a firm reaches the bottom of its learning curve after just two sales. However, examples are also constructed for the two-step learning case in which neither ID nor IID holds. It is also shown that, in equilibrium, IID implies that learning is privately disadvantageous, although it is socially advantageous. Finally, introducing avoidable fixed costs and possible exit into the model yields a new theory of predatory pricing based on the learning curve hypothesis.",Luis M. B. Cabral and Michael H.

Generalized Ginis are orderings which can be represented by quasi-concave, nondecreasing functions that are linear in rank-ordered subspaces of Euclidean n-space. Our characterization of (multi-valued) generalized Gini bargaining solutions is based on a linear invariance requirement in addition to some standard conditions. Linear invariance requires that if the feasible set is changed by adding a constant to one agent's component of each vector of the feasible set (without changing the agent's rank order), the solution responds by adding the same constant to the corresponding agent's utility in the outcome of the problem. Weak linear invariance requires the solution to change in a parallel way if a constant is added to all components of each vector of the feasible set. In the two-person case, the generalized Gini bargaining solutions can be characterized by imposing weak linear invariance, whereas, for n ⩾ 3 agents, linear invariance is required. As a by-product of our main result, we show that the egalitarian bargaining solution is characterized if single-valuedness is required together with some of our axioms. The main focus of cooperative bargaining theory has been the characterization of single-valued solutions. The results of this paper demonstrate that relaxing this assumption enlarges the class of solutions considerably. Hence, single-valuedness is not merely an assumption of convenience but, rather, an assumption of substance.","Charles Blackorby, Walter Bossert and David Donaldson",Charles Blackorby,Walter Bossert,David Donaldson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

These two equilibrium refinements are motivated in very different ways. Nonetheless, as Kreps and Wilson (1982, Section 7) point out, the two concepts lead to similar prescriptions for equilibrium play. For each particular game form, every perfect equilibrium is sequential. Moreover, for almost all assignments of payoffs to outcomes, almost all sequential equilibrium strategy profiles are perfect equilibrium profiles, and all sequential equilibrium outcomes are perfect equilibrium outcomes. We establish a stronger result: For almost all assignments of payoffs to outcomes, the sets of sequential and perfect equilibrium strategy profiles are identical. In other words, for almost all games each strategy profile which can be supported by beliefs satisfying the rationality requirement of sequential equilibrium can actually be supported by beliefs satisfying the stronger rationality requirement of perfect equilibrium. We obtain this result by exploiting the algebraic/geometric structure of these equilibrium correspondences, following from the fact that they are semi-algebraic sets; i.e., they are defined by finite systems of polynomial inequalities. That the perfect and sequential equilibrium correspondences have this semi-algebraic structure follows from a deep result from mathematical logic, the Tarski-Seidenberg Theorem; that this structure has important game-theoretic consequences follows from deep properties of semi-algebraic sets.",Lawrence E.

This paper shows how the model, which has so far been restricted to economies with a finite horizon, can be extended to the more natural setting of an open-ended future, thereby providing an extension of the finite horizon representative agent models of modern macroeconomics to economies with heterogeneous agents and incomplete markets. There are two natural concepts of equilibrium over an infinite horizon which prevent agents from entering into Ponzi schemes, that is, from indefinitely postponing the repayment of their debts. The first is based on debt constraints which place bounds on debt at each date-event; the second is based on transversality conditions which limit the asymptotic rate of growth of debt. The concept of an equilibrium with debt constraint is a natural concept of equilibrium for macroeconomic analysis; however the concept of an equilibrium with transversality condition is more amenable to theoretical analysis since it permits the powerful techniques of Arrow-Debreu theory to be carried over to the setting of incomplete markets. In an economy in which agents are impatient (expressed by the Mackey continuity of their preference orderings) and have a degree of impatience at each date-event which is bounded below (a concept defined in the paper), we show that the equilibria of an economy with transversality condition coincide with the equilibria with debt constraints. An equilibrium with transversality condition is shown to exist: it follows that for each economy there is an explicit bound M such that an equilibrium with explicit debt constraint M exists, in which the constraint is never binding--this latter property ensuring that the debt constraint, whose objective is to prevent Ponzi schemes, does not in itself introduce a new imperfection into the model over and above the incompleteness of the markets.",Michael Magill and Martine Quinzii,Michael Magill,Martine Quinzii,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

This feature of the Shapley value allocation is not necessarily shared by the rational expectation equilibrium. Thus, we analyze the informational structure of an economy with differential information from a different and new viewpoint. In particular we address the following questions: How do coalitions of agents share their private information? How can one measure the information advantage or superiority of an agent? Is each agent's private information verifiable by other members of a coalition? Do coalitions of agents pool their private information? Do agents have an incentive to report their true private information? What is the correct concept of a value allocation in an economy with differential information?

Unanticipated returns are assumed to depend both on innovations in ""observable"" economic variables and on ""unobservable"" factors. The risk premium on an asset is a linear combination of the risk premia associated with factors. We find that idiosyncratic risk is significantly priced, and that the ""price of risk"" is not common across countries. This either can be interpreted as evidence against the null of integrated capital markets or could reflect the failure of some other maintained assumptions. Another empirical finding is that only a small proportion of the covariances between national stock markets and their time-variation can be accounted for by ""observable"" economic variables.

This consists in choosing a specific gridding of the time horizon, and considering the optimal solution computed using this restricted set of dates as an approximation to the underlying continuous- or more disaggregated discrete-time formulation. A procedure generally adopted for time aggregation in applied intertemporal optimization economic models using mathematical programming techniques is shown to be inappropriate, as it introduces a dependency of the solution steady state to a specific choice of sequence of time intervals. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions to avoid this dependency, i.e., to ensure that the discretization satisfies steady-state invariance. The result is a considerable improvement in the numerical accuracy of the time-aggregated approximation. These easy-to-handle conditions are shown to apply to a broad class of models such as multidimensional intertemporal problems and endogenous growth models and may therefore prove extremely powerful in applied works such as large-scale applied general-equilibrium modeling.

Multivariate first-order approximations to the distributions are derived under normality, using a parameter sequence where the number of instruments increases as the number of observations increases. Numerical results show these approximations are more accurate, compared to large-sample approximations, even if the number of instruments is small. The moments of the multivariate limit distributions of the MM and MMK estimators can be consistently estimated under a variety of parameter sequences, including the large-sample sequence. The new approximate confidence regions perform well in terms of exact levels, compared to traditional ones.

In such situations, it is known that contract renegotiation may prevent the implementation of first-best outcomes. In this paper, we show however that efficient investments and optimal risk-sharing can typically be achieved provided the initial contract is able to monitor the ex post renegotiation process. Specifically, we focus on the following two features of renegotiation design. First, default options in case renegotiation breaks down; second, the allocation of all bargaining power to either contracting party. Moreover, we show that these two features can be obtained in standard Rubinstein bargaining games through contractual provisions, such as specific-performance clauses and penalties for delay (or, equivalently, financial ""hostages"" refundable without interest).","Philippe Aghion, Mathias Dewatripont and Patrick Rey",Philippe Aghion,Mathias Dewatripont,Patrick Rey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

As a result, no meaningful distinction is allowed between risk, where probabilities are available to guide choice, and uncertainty, where information is too imprecise to be summarized adequately by probabilities. In contrast, Knight and Keynes emphasized the distinction between risk and uncertainty and argued that uncertainty is more common in economic decision-making. Moreover, the Savage model is contradicted by evidence, such as the Ellsberg Paradox, that people prefer to act on known rather than unknown or vague probabilities. This paper provides a formal model of asset price determination in which Knightian uncertainty plays a role. Specifically, we extend the Lucas (1978) general equilibrium pure exchange economy by suitably generalizing the representation of beliefs along the lines suggested by Gilboa and Schmeidler. Two principal results are the proof of existence of equilibrium and the characterization of equilibrium prices by an ""Euler inequality."" A noteworthy feature of the model is that uncertainty may lead to equilibria that are indeterminate, that is, there may exist a continuum of equilibria for given fundamentals. That leaves the determination of a particular equilibrium price process to ""animal spirits"" and sizable volatility may result. Finally, it is argued that empirical investigation of our model is potentially fruitful.",Larry G. Epstein and Tan Wang,Larry G. Epstein,Tan Wang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The experimental results indicate that while each of the theories helps to explain some aspects of the data, none of these theories are completely consistent with the data. In relative terms, the Edgeworth cycle theory provides better predictions than the other three theories. Most sellers adjusted their prices partially to their predicted Edgeworth price. The Edgeworth cycle theory is the only theory that predicts the kind of time dependence and cycling that was observed in most experiments.","Jamie Brown Kruse, Stephen Rassenti, Stanley S.

The quantile regression technique parsimoniously describes the entire conditional wage distribution. This conditional distribution is used to examine changes in within-group wage inequality as measured by the difference between conditional quantiles. Two linear models are considered: a simple one-group model, and a 16-group model.

These results help to explain some recent simulation studies where extreme outliers are found to occur more frequently for the reduced rank regression estimator than for alternative asymptotically efficient procedures that are based on the triangular representation.

The estimator also performs well relative to simulated ML, even when a highly accurate method is used to simulate the choice probabilities.

A comparison of transition rates using these quarterly records with the more typical biannual records from the RHS and other sources reveals substantial undercounts in the biannual data, indicating that the prevalence of labor force movements at older ages has been underestimated previously. The quarterly data reveal a much sharper spike in the exit rate at exact age 65 than is found in data measured at less frequent intervals. Estimates are presented of the parameters of a reduced form model of labor force transitions. A novel feature of the model is the exploration of dynamic aspects of labor force behavior at older ages. The results show that labor force dynamics at older ages are important, including duration and spell occurrence dependence, and work experience effects. These effects are robust to nonparametric controls for unobserved heterogeneity. The estimates indicate that social security benefits have strong effects on the timing of labor force transitions at older ages, but that changes in social security benefit levels over time have not contributed much to the trend toward earlier labor force exit.",David M.

Imperfect player control is generated by an exogenous uniformly-distributed random delay in offer transmission. Our model has a symmetric Markov-perfect equilibrium, unique at almost all nodes, in which players adopt strategic delay early in the game, make and reject offers later on, and reach agreements late in the game if at all.

Earlier work by Sims, Stock, and Watson (1990) on trivariate VAR systems is extended to the general case, thereby formally characterizing the circumstances when these Wald tests are asymptotically valid as χ <sup>2</sup> criteria. Our results for inference from unrestricted levels VAR are not encouraging. We show that without explicit information on the number of unit roots in the system and the rank of certain submatrices in the cointegration space it is impossible to determine the appropriate limit theory in advance; and, even when such information is available, the limit theory often involves both nuisance parameters and nonstandard distributions, a situation where there is no satisfactory statistical basis for mounting these tests. The situation with regard to the use of causality tests in ECM's is also complex but more encouraging. Granger causality tests in ECM's also suffer from nuisance parameter dependencies asymptotically and, in some cases that we make explicit, nonstandard limit theory. Both these results are somewhat surprising in the light of earlier research on the validity of asymptotic χ <sup>2</sup> criteria in such systems. In spite of these difficulties, Johansen-type ECM's do offer a sound basis for empirical testing of the rank of the cointegration space and the rank of key submatrices that influence the asymptotics.",Hiro Y.

Third, we compare the bound for index models with the asymptotic variance of weighted average derivative estimators of the index coefficients. We characterize the form of the optimal weight function when the distribution of the regressors is elliptically symmetric.

The game setup is an extension of the one-shot signalling game in which an infinite number of rounds of renegotiation are permitted before contracted actions are in fact executed. The main results of the paper are (1) executed contracts may still contain distortions although players can never commit not to renegotiate, (2) the popular ""efficient"" separating-equilibrium outcome of one-shot signalling games is never an equilibrium outcome when an infinite number of rounds of renegotiation are permitted, (3) standard incentive-compatibility constraints can be easily generalized to incorporate situations that allow for an infinite number of rounds of renegotiation, (4) equilibrium outcomes can be separating and nevertheless depend on the uninformed player's priors as informed types pool in the first stage and use the renegotiation stages to separate, (5) renegotiation in signalling games may lead to outcomes similar to equilibrium outcomes of screening games in which multiple contract purchases are allowed.",Paul Beaudry and Michel Poitevin,Paul Beaudry,Michel Poitevin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The results apply to a wide class of parametric models that are suitable for estimation by generalized method of moments procedures. The paper considers Wald, Lagrange multiplier, and likelihood ratio-like tests. Each test implicitly uses an estimate of a change point. The change point may be completely unknown or it may be known to lie in a restricted interval. Tests of both ""pure"" and ""partial"" structural change are discussed. The asymptotic distributions of the test statistics considered here are nonstandard because the change point parameter only appears under the alternative hypothesis and not under the null. The asymptotic null distributions are found to be given by the supremum of the square of a standardized tied-down Bessel process of order p ⩾ 1, as in D. L. Hawkins (1987). Tables of critical values are provided based on this asymptotic null distribution. As tests of parameter instability, the tests considered here are shown to have nontrivial asymptotic local power against all alternatives for which the parameters are nonconstant. As tests of one-time structural change, the tests are shown to have some weak asymptotic local power optimality properties for large sample size and small significance level.

Comparing the conditional moment profiles to baseline profiles is the nonlinear analog of conventional impulse-response analysis. The approach includes strategies for laying out realistic perturbation experiments in multivariate situations and for undertaking statistical inference using bootstrap methods. It also includes examination of profile bundles for evidence of damping or persistence.

Consumers search sequentially and stores advertise (with various intensity) when it is in their interest to do so. Our model has a unique equilibrium exhibiting price dispersion. The model generates predictions about the shape of the price distribution and firms' advertising behavior. We explore the effects of entry, and find that when initial advertising costs (at zero level of effort) are precisely zero, entry drives the equilibrium to the perfectly competitive outcome. However, when initial marginal advertising costs are positive, entry drives prices higher, and while the informed consumers almost surely locate competitive prices, welfare does not necessarily increase. Finally, we compare the effectiveness of the two informational channels. When advertising costs shrink, prices become competitive; however, when search costs shrink, prices remain bounded above marginal production costs.",Jacques Robert and Dale O.

Such an equilibrium can be interpreted as the ""conventional"" way of playing the game. If, in addition, the players sometimes experiment or make mistakes, then society occasionally switches from one convention to another. As the likelihood of mistakes goes to zero, only some conventions (equilibria) have positive probability in the limit. These are known as stochastically stable equilibria.

The optimal consumption policy in our solution consists of a possible initial ""gulp"" of consumption, or a period of no consumption, followed by a process of cumulative consumption with singular sample paths. In almost all states of nature, the agent consumes periodically and invests more in the risky assets than an agent with time-additive utility whose felicity function has the same curvature and the same time-discount parameter.

A common finding in many of these studies with high frequency financial or monetary data concerns the presence of an approximate unit root in the autoregressive polynomial in the univariate time series representation for the conditional second order moments of the process, as in the so-called integrated generalized ARCH (IGARCH) class of models proposed in Engle and Bollerslev (1986). In the IGARCH models shocks to the conditional variance are persistent, in the sense that they remain important for forecasts of all horizons. This idea is readily extended to a multivariate framework. Even though many time series may exhibit persistence in variance, it is likely that several different variables share the same common long-run component. In that situation, the variables are naturally defined to be co-persistent in variance, and the co-persistent linear combination is interpretable as a long-run relationship. Conditions for co-persistence to occur in the multivariate linear GARCH model are presented. These conditions parallel the conditions for linear co-integration in the mean, as developed by Engle and Granger (1987). The presence of co-persistence has important implications for asset pricing relationships and in optimal portfolio allocation decisions. An empirical example relating to the time series properties of nominal U.S. dollar exchange rates for the deutschemark and the British pound provides a simple illustration of the ideas.",Tim Bollerslev and Robert F.

It includes in the set of events both unambiguous events for which probabilities are additive and ambiguous events for which probabilities are permitted to be nonadditive. The main axiom is cumulative dominance, which adapts stochastic dominance to decision making under uncertainty. We derive a Choquet expected utility representation and show that a modification of cumulative dominance leads to the classical expected utility representation. The relationship of our approach with that of Schmeidler, who uses a two-stage formulation to derive Choquet expected utility, is also explored.

These properties follow from the feasibility of Bertrand undercutting with nonuniform prices. When there is free entry, zero-profit minimum average cost production occurs in equilibrium. If, in addition, average cost attains its minimum at any quantity below market output, all prices collapse to a uniform price equal to minimum average cost. A necessary condition for existence of this equilibrium is derived and compared to similar conditions from uniform price theory. Analogies to uniform price theory depend on the rationing capabilities of nonuniform prices and the rationing assumptions employed in uniform price models. Without free entry, prices may not collapse to a uniform price in equilibrium. Also, positive profit may occur but all firms must earn equal profit and incur equal marginal cost, while consumers pay average outlay no greater than marginal cost.",David M. Mandy,David M.

The paper provides therefore a useful framework for global dynamic analysis of phenomena whose modeling requires a multi-dimensional commodity space. The analysis demonstrates that gross substitutability in consumption is not sufficient to ensure the determinacy of equilibrium in this production economy. However, if in addition the investment good is capital intensive and second period consumption of two-period-lived individuals is a normal good, then the perfect-foresight equilibrium is globally unique. If the consumption good is capital intensive, global uniqueness does not hold despite the existence of gross substitutability and normality in consumption.

We consider social choice functions (scf's) which map from a finite set of preference profiles to lotteries over alternatives, and require virtual implementation in iteratively undominated strategies. An scf x is virtually implementable in iteratively undominated strategies if for all ε > 0, there exists an scf y which is ε-close to x (that is, for all preference profiles, x and y map to lotteries which are within ε of one another) and which is (exactly) implementable in iteratively undominated strategies. Under very weak domain restrictions we show that if there are three or more players, any scf is virtually implementable in iteratively undominated strategies. A noteworthy feature of our constructions is that we only employ finite mechanisms. As a corollary, we obtain virtual implementation in (pure and) mixed strategy Nash equilibrium using well-behaved (in particular, finite) mechanisms. The literature on implementation in Nash equilibrium and its refinements is compromised by its reliance on game forms with unnatural features (for example, ""integer"" games), or ""modulo"" constructions with mixed strategies arbitrarily excluded.

The number of types in the support of an arm, as also the types themselves, are allowed to vary across the arms. We derive certain continuity and curvature properties of the dynamic allocation (or Gittins) index of Gittins and Jones (1974), and provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which the Gittins-Jones result identifying all optimal strategies for finite-armed bandits may be extended to infinite-armed bandits. We then establish our central result: at each point in time, the arm selected by an optimal strategy will, with strictly positive probability, remain an optimal selection forever. More specifically, for every such arm, there exists (at least) one type of that arm such that, when conditioned on that type being the arm's ""true"" type, the arm will survive forever and continuously with nonzero probability. When the reward distributions of an arm satisfy the monotone likelihood ratio property (MLRP), the survival prospects of an arm improve when conditioned on types generating higher expected rewards; however, we show how this need not be the case in the absence of MLRP.

It also reveals the logic behind some of the more interesting results of the Nash bargaining solution such as the comparative statics of risk aversion and the connection between the Nash bargaining solution and strategic models.","Ariel Rubinstein, Zvi Safra and William Thomson",Ariel Rubinstein,Zvi Safra,William Thomson,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Thus if equilibrium prices for consumption come from the duals, consumptions at nearly adjacent dates in a state of nature have almost equal prices except possibly at information surprises. In particular, if the information structure is generated by a Brownian motion, the duals are composed of Itô processes. We investigate some implications of our topologies on standard models of choice in continuous time as well as on recent models of non-time-separable representations of preferences.

The experimental results show that this does not occur. An alternative explanation for the data can be given if we reconsider the game as a game of incomplete information in which there is some uncertainty over the payoff functions of the players.

Trimmed least absolute deviations (LAD) and trimmed least squares estimators are proposed for the case where the panel is of length two, and it is proven that they are consistent and asymptotically normal under suitable regularity conditions. It is not necessary to maintain parametric assumptions on the error terms to obtain this result. Because three of the four estimators are defined as minimizers of nondifferentiable functions, traditional methods cannot be used to establish asymptotic normality. Instead, the approach of Pakes and Pollard (1989) is used. A small scale Monte Carlo study demonstrates that these estimators can perform well in small samples.

The data form a random sample from a distribution F. There is a given function of the data and a parameter. The restriction is that a conditional expectation of this function is zero at some point in the parameter space. The parameter has two parts: a finite-dimensional component θ and a general function h, which is evaluated at a subset of the conditioning variables. An example is a regression function that is additive in parametric and nonparametric components, as arises in sample selection models. If F is assumed to be multinomial with known (finite) support, then the problem becomes parametric, with the values of h at the mass points forming part of the parameter vector. Then an efficiency bound for θ and for linear functionals of h can be obtained from the Fisher information matrix, as in Chamberlain (1987). The bound depends only upon certain conditional moments and not upon the support of the distribution. A general F satisfying the restrictions can be approximated by a multinomial distribution satisfying the restrictions, and so the explicit form of the multinomial bound applies in general. The efficiency bound for θ is extended to a more general model in which different components of h may depend on different known functions of the variables. Although an explicit form for the bound is no longer available, a variational characterization of the bound is provided. The efficiency bound is applied to a random coefficients model for panel data, in which the conditional expectation of the random coefficients given covariates plays the role of the function h. An instrumental-variables estimator is set up within a finite-dimensional, method-of-moments framework. The bound provides guidance on the choice of instrumental variables.",Gary Chamberlain,Gary Chamberlain,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

As a byproduct of the analysis, we also prove (under the same set of assumptions) a uniform version of the Coase Conjecture: When the time interval between successive periods is made sufficiently short, the initial serious offer by either party in an alternating-offer bargaining game must be less than ε times the highest possible buyer valuation, for an entire family of distribution functions.",Lawrence M.

Although the notion of weak sequential rationality developed here is based upon extensive form considerations, it bears a close relation to Selten's (1975) normal form perfect equilibria. Also, a class of restrictions one might impose upon out of equilibrium beliefs is suggested. The weakest of these results from the assumption that deviators are expected utility maximizers. The strongest yields backward induction outcomes in generic games with perfect information.

Equilibrium is determined by a forward-looking difference equation, according to which the amount of research in any period depends upon the expected amount of research next period. One source of this intertemporal relationship is creative destruction. That is, the prospect of more future research discourages current research by threatening to destroy the rents created by current research. The paper analyzes the positive and normative properties of stationary equilibria, in which research employment is constant and GNP follows a random walk with drift, although under some circumstances cyclical equilibria also exist. Both the average growth rate and the variance of the growth rate are increasing functions of the size of innovations, the size of the skilled labor force, and the productivity of research as measured by a parameter indicating the effect of research on the Poisson arrival rate of innovations; and decreasing functions of the rate of time preference of the representative individual. Under laissez faire the economy's growth rate may be more or less than optimal because, in addition to the appropriability and intertemporal spillover effects of other endogenous growth models, which tend to make growth slower than optimal, the model also has effects that work in the opposite direction. In particular, the fact that private research firms do not internalize the destruction of rents generated by their innovations introduces a business-stealing effect similar to that found in the partial-equilibrium patent race literature. When we endogenize the size of innovations we find that business stealing also makes innovations too small.",Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt,Philippe Aghion,Peter Howitt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We analyze such a principal-agent relationship as a noncooperative game. The principal proposes a contract, which is accepted or rejected by the agent (who, for most of our analysis, has no private information). The contract is executed if accepted; otherwise, the reservation allocation takes effect. This allocation may be determined by a pre-existing contract (which the principal, by her proposal, is attempting to renegotiate), or it may simply be the no-trade point. In this paper, we assume that the principal's information directly affects the agent's payoff. Before solving the game, we discuss Pareto efficiency with asymmetric information. We define an incentive-compatible allocation to be weakly interim efficient (WIE) if there exists no alternative incentive-compatible allocation that both parties prefer for all possible beliefs that the agent might have about the principal's private information (type). We show that any WIE allocation is interim-efficient (IE) for some beliefs. The Rothschild-Stiglitz-Wilson (RSW) allocation relative to the reservation allocation <tex-math>$\mu _{0}^{\cdot}$</tex-math> is the allocation that maximizes the payoff of each type of principal within the class of incentive-compatible allocations that guarantee the agent at least the utility he gets from <tex-math>$\mu _{0}^{\cdot}$</tex-math> irrespective of his beliefs about the principal's type. The equilibrium set of the contract proposal game consists of the allocations that weakly Pareto dominate the RSW allocation. Thus, there is a unique equilibrium outcome if and only if the latter is IE (and the equilibrium outcome is the RSW allocation itself). After characterizing the equilibrium allocations, we study those that are renegotiation-proof, when either the principal or the agent leads the renegotiation. We then compare our contract proposal game, which is a signaling model, with its ""screening"" counterpart. We conclude by extending our results to the case in which the agent as well as the principal has private information under the assumption of quasi-linear preferences.",Eric Maskin and Jean Tirole,Eric Maskin,Jean Tirole,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Three types of invariance are considered: invariance to the representation of the null hypothesis, invariance to one-to-one transformations of the parameter space (reparametrizations), and invariance to one-to-one transformations of the model variables such as changes in measurement units. Tests that are not invariant include the Wald test and generalized versions of it, a widely used variant of the Lagrane multiplier test, Neyman's C(α) test, and a generalized version of the latter. For all these tests, we show that simply changing measurement units can lead to vastly different answers even when equivalent null hypotheses are tested. This problem is illustrated by considering regression models with Box-Cox transformations on the variables. We observe, in particular, that various consistent estimators of the information matrix lead to test procedures with different invariance properties. General sufficient conditions are then established, under which the generalized C(α) test becomes invariant to reformulations of the null hypothesis and/or to one-to-one transformations of the parameter space as well as to transformations of the variables. In many practical cases where Wald-type tests lack invariance, we find that special formulations of the generalized C(α) test are invariant and hardly more costly to compute than Wald tests. This computational simplicity stands in contrast with other invariant tests such as the likelihood ratio test. We conclude that noninvariant asymptotic tests should be avoided or used with great care. Further, in many situations, the suggested implementation of the generalized C(α) test often yields an attractive substitute to the Wald test (which is not invariant) and to other invariant tests (which are more costly to perform).",Marcel G.

When consumers are relatively impatient, and when labor income is independently and identically distributed over time, assets act like a buffer stock, protecting consumption against bad draws of income. The precautionary demand for saving interacts with the borrowing constraints to provide a motive for holding assets. If the income process is positively autocorrelated, but stationary, assets are still used to buffer consumption, but do so less effectively and at a greater cost in terms of foregone consumption. In the limit, when labor income is a random walk, it is optimal for impatient liquidity constrained consumers simply to consume their incomes. As a consequence, a liquidity constrained representative agent cannot generate aggregate U.S. saving behavior if that agent receives aggregate labor income. Either there is no saving, when income is a random walk, or saving is contracyclical over the business cycle, when income changes are positively autocorrelated. However, in reality, microeconomic income processes do not resemble their average, and it is possible to construct a model of microeconomic saving under liquidity constraints which, at the aggregate level, reproduces many of the stylized facts in the actual data. While it is clear that many households are not liquidity constrained, and do not behave as described here, the models presented in the paper seem to account for important aspects of reality that are not explained by traditional life-cycle models.",Angus Deaton,Angus Deaton,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The systematic subutility is assumed to possess properties, such as monotonicity and concavity, that are typically assumed in microeconomic theory.

A result on uniform convergence of spectral density estimates is established and applied in developing robust large-sample inference procedures based on instrumental variables estimates of a fairly general linear system with disturbances that have serial correlation of unknown form. Optimal instruments depend on the spectral density of the disturbances and on the frequency response function, and the latter is also nonparametric when the system is incomplete. The system may be parameterized over only a proper subset of the sampling frequencies. We adapt to these nonparametric features, justifying feasible, asymptotically optimal parameter estimates. The above results all assume covariance stationarity of the data, except for the special case of a multivariate linear regression model for which certain trending explanatory variables are permitted. In all these results, the degree of smoothing is allowed to depend on the data in a quite general way.

These conditions are similar to ones studied by Schmeidler and Vind (1972) and Vind (1978), but here they are thought of as characterizing the set of net trades available in steady state equilibria of market games like those studied by Douglas Gale (1984, 1985, 1986a, 1986b, and 1986c). The characterization result is used as a key step in the proof of results like Gale's: the allocations induced by steady state equilibria are Walrasian for the economy given by the (constant) flow of new agents into the market. Our approach generalizes the one followed in Gale (1986c) and allows us to dispense with assumptions made in previous treatments.

Game theory is viewed as an abstract inquiry into the concepts used in social reasoning when dealing with situations of conflict and not as an attempt to predict behavior. The first half of the paper deals with the notion of ""strategy."" Its principal claim is that the conventional interpretation of a ""strategy"" is not consistent with the manner in which it is applied, and that this inconsistency frequently results in confusion and misunderstanding. In order to prove this point, the term ""strategy"" is discussed in three contexts: extensive games in which players have to act more than once in some prespecified order, games normally analyzed using mixed strategies, and games with limited memory. The paper endorses the view that equilibrium strategy describes a player's plan of action, as well as those considerations which support the optimality of his plan rather than being merely a description of a ""plan of action."" Deviation from the perception of a strategy as a mere ""plan of action"" fits in well with the interpretation of the notion ""game"" which is discussed in the second half of this paper. It is argued that a good model in game theory has to be realistic in the sense that it provides a model for the perception of real life social phenomena. It should incorporate a description of the relevant factors involved, as perceived by the decision makers. These need not necessarily represent the physical rules of the world. It is not meant to be isomorphic with respect to ""reality"" but rather with respect to our perception of regular phenomena in reality.",Ariel Rubinstein,Ariel Rubinstein,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Say that a soical choice function f is virtually implementable in Nash equilibrium if for all ε > 0 there exists a game from G such that for all preference profiles θ, G has a unique equilibrium outcome x(θ), and x(θ) is ε-close to f(θ). (This definition may be directly extended to social choice correspondences.) Then (under mild domain restrictions) the following result is true: In societies with at least three individuals all social choice correspondences are virtually implementable in Nash equilibrium. This proposition should be contrasted with Maskin's (1977) classic characterization, according to which the nontrivial requirement of monotonicity is a necessary condition for exact implementation in Nash equilibrium. The two-person case needs to be considered separately. We provide a complete characterization of virtually implementable two-person social choice functions. While not all two-person social choice functions are virtually implementable, our necessary and sufficient condition is simple. This contrasts with the rather complex necessary and sufficient conditions for exact implementation. We show how our results can be extended to implementation in strict Nash equilibrium and coalition-proof Nash equilibrium, to social choice correspondences which map from cardinal preference profiles to lotteries, and to environments with a continuum of pure alternatives.",Dilip Abreu and Arunava Sen,Dilip Abreu,Arunava Sen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

For a given, finite, set of equations, the instrument achieving the lower variance bound for instrumental variables estimates is a nonparametric regression function. We approximate this without use of smoothed nonparametric estimation: our feasible optimal instruments average over the unsmoothed empirical distribution of preliminary residuals. We justify the method under stationary serial dependence. Somewhat different estimates are proposed in each of three settings: independent disturbances and strongly exogenous but possibly serially dependent explanatory variables; independent disturbances and explanatory variables that include lagged response variables; parametrically autocorrelated disturbances and strongly exogenous but possibly serially dependent explanatory variables. In each case large-sample inference rules are justified. The limiting normal distribution of the estimates is found to be unaffected if the optimal instruments are based on only an arbitrarily small, vanishing fraction of the residuals. In the setting of independent observations we investigate theoretically the effect of such computational savings on the goodness of the normal approximation, obtaining a rate of uniform convergence to normality.",P.

The quality of the χ <sup>2</sup> approximation depends upon the method chosen to compute the test. Failure to exploit restrictions on the covariance matrix of the test can lead to a test with appalling finite sample properties. Order O(n<sup>-1</sup>) approximations to the exact distribution of an efficient form of the IM test are reported. These are developed from asymptotic expansions of the Edgeworth and Cornish-Fisher types. They are compared with Monte Carlo estimates of the finite sample distribution of the test and are found to be superior to the usual χ <sup>2</sup> approximations in sample sizes of the magnitude found in applied micro-econometric work. The methods developed in the paper are applied to normal and exponential models and to normal regression models. Results are provided for the full IM test and for heteroskedasticity and nonnormality diagnostic tests which are special cases of the IM test. In general the quality of alternative approximations is sensitive to covariate design.

Results in the literature provide a condition on the growth rate of the lag truncation parameter as T → ∞ that is sufficient for consistency. No results are available, however, regarding the choice of lag truncation parameter for a fixed sample size, regarding data-dependent automatic lag truncation parameters, or regarding the choice of weighting scheme. In consequence, available estimators are not entirely operational and the relative merits of the estimators are unknown. This paper addresses these problems.

Alternative formulations of such models are considered including a new triangular system error correction mechanism. It is shown that full system maximum likelihood brings the problem of inference within the family that is covered by the locally asymptotically mixed normal asymptotic theory provided that all unit roots in the system have been eliminated by specification and data transformation. This result has far reaching consequences. It means that cointegrating coefficient estimates are symmetrically distributed and median unbiased asymptotically, that an optimal asymptotic theory of inference applies, and that hypothesis tests may be conducted using standard asymptotic chi-squared tests. In short, this solves problems of specification and inference in cointegrated systems that have recently troubled many investigators. Methodological issues are also addressed and these provide the major focus of the paper. Our results favor the use of full system estimation in error correction mechanisms or subsystem methods that are asymptotically equivalent. They also point to disadvantages in the use of unrestricted VAR's that are formulated in levels and in certain single equation approaches to the estimation of error correction mechanisms. Unrestricted VAR's implicitly estimate unit roots that are present in the system and the relevant asymptotic theory for the VAR estimates of the cointegrating subspace inevitably involves unit root asymptotics. Single equation error correction mechanisms generally suffer from similar disadvantages through the neglect of additional equations in the system. Both examples point to the importance of the proper use of information in the estimation of cointegrated systems. In classical estimation theory the neglect of information typically results in a loss of statistical efficiency. In cointegrated systems deeper consequences occur. Single equation and VAR approaches sacrifice asymptotic median unbiasedness as well as optimality and they run into inferential difficulties through the presence of nuisance parameters in the limit distributions. The advantages of the use of fully specified systems techniques are shown to be all the more compelling in the light of these alternatives. Attention is also given to the information content that is necessary to achieve optimal estimation of the cointegrating coefficients. It is shown that optimal estimation of the latter does not require simultaneous estimation of the transient dynamics even when the parameters of the transient dynamics are functionally dependent on the parameters of the cointegrating relationship. All that is required is consistent estimation of the long run covariance matrix of the system residuals and this covariance matrix estimate can be utilized in regression formulae of the generalized least squares type. Thus, optimal estimation can be achieved without a detailed specification of the system's transient responses and thus, in practice, without the use of eigenvalue routines such as those employed in the Johansen (1988) procedure.",P.

This paper develops and tests two variants of the permanent income model that are consistent with this fact. In both variants, we assume agents make decisions on a continuous time basis. According to the first variant, the martingale hypothesis holds in continuous time and serial persistence in measured consumption reflects only the effects of time aggregation. We investigate this variant using both structural and atheoretical econometric models. The evidence against these models is far from overwhelming. This suggests that the martingale hypothesis may yet be a useful way to conceptualize the relationship between aggregate quarterly U.S. consumption and income. According to the second variant of the permanent income model, serial persistence in measured consumption reflects the effects of exogenous technology shocks and time aggregation. In this model, continuous time consumption does not behave like a martingale. We find little evidence against this variant of the permanent income model. It is difficult, on the basis of aggregate quarterly U.S. data, to convincingly distinguish between the different continuous time models considered in the paper.","Lawrence J.

Many common welfare criteria, such as the Pareto correspondence, and several familiar voting rules, such as majority and plurality rules, satisfy our conditions.

The conventional Bayesian theory of choice under uncertainty, subjective expected utility (SEU) theory, fails to satisfy these properties--weakly dominated acts may be chosen, and the usual definition of conditional probabilities applies only to non-null events. This paper develops a non-Archimedean variant of SEU where decision makers have lexicographic beliefs; that is, there are (first-order) likely events as well as (higher-order) events which are infinitely less likely but not necessarily impossible. This generalization of preferences, from those having an SEU representation to those having a representation with lexicographic beliefs, can be made to satisfy admissibility and yield well defined conditional probabilities and at the same time to allow for ""null"" events. The need for a synthesis of expected utility with admissibility, and to provide a ranking of null events, has often been stressed in the decision theory literature. Furthermore, lexicographic beliefs are appropriate for characterizing refinements of Nash equilibrium. In this paper we discuss: axioms on, and behavioral properties of, individual preferences which characterize lexicographic beliefs; probability-theoretic properties of the representations; and the relationships with other recent extensions of Bayesian SEU theory.","Lawrence Blume, Adam Brandenburger and Eddie Dekel",Lawrence Blume,Adam Brandenburger,Eddie Dekel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The approach relies on a theory of single-person decision making that is a non-Archimedean version of subjective expected utility theory. According to this theory, each player in a game possesses, in addition to a strategy space and a utility function on outcomes, a vector of probability distributions, called a lexicographic probability system (LPS), on the strategies chosen by the other players. These probability distributions can be interpreted as the player's first-order and higher order theories as to how the game will be played, and are used lexicographically in determining an optimal strategy. We define an equilibirum concept, called lexicographic Nash equilibrium, that extends the notion of Nash equilibrium in that it dictates not only a strategy for each player but also an LPS on the strategies chosen by the other players. Perfect and proper equilibria are described as lexicogrpahic Nash equilibria by placing various restrictions on the LPS's possessed by the players.","Lawrence Blume, Adam Brandenburger and Eddie Dekel",Lawrence Blume,Adam Brandenburger,Eddie Dekel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We compare the predictions of a theoretical model of a common knowledge inference process with actual behavior. In the theoretical model, ""perfect Bayesians,"" starting with private information, take actions; an aggregate statistic is made publicly available; the individuals do optimal Bayesian updating and take new actions; and the process continues until there is a common knowledge equilibrium with complete information pooling. We find that the theoretical model roughly predicts the observed behavior, but the actual inference process is clearly less efficient than the standard of the theoretical model, and while there is some pooling, it is incomplete.",Richard D.

By a property of the correlated equilibrium, a similar result holds also with the Nash equilibrium solution concept. The scheme of plain conversation is universal because it does not depend on the specification of the game, nor on the solution to achieve and it is easily implemented in any institutional context.

They defined a number of different solution concepts of the following general form: a stable set of equilibria is a minimal closed set of equilibria such that all small perturbations of the game have equilibria close to the stable set. Their definitions varied with the definition of a small perturbation. Unfortunately none of their definitions satisfied all of their requirements. We show that by changing the definition of a perturbation it is possible to define a solution concept that does satisfy all of the requirements. In the main definition of this paper we look not at perturbations of the payoffs or the strategy space but directly at perturbations of the best reply correspondence. With the appropriate topology on this space of perturbations the resulting definition does satisfy all of the requirements. We also show that one does not have much freedom in the topology one uses.,John Hillas,John Hillas,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Rising female wages delay times to all conceptions and reduce total conceptions. This result is robust across a variety of empirical specifications. In the best fitting models in which marital status is excluded, male incomes--defined to be zero for unmarried women without a cohabiting male partner--reduce times to conceptions and increase total conceptions. The results on female wages are robust across a variety of empirical specifications, but those on male incomes are not robust to the introduction of marital status and cohabitational status variables, even though models with such variables can be rejected by our model specification tests. We find a particular neoclassical model that predicts fertility attained at different ages as well as the aggregate time series of birth rates. A model that excludes wages and incomes predicts fertility attained at different ages but fails to predict the aggregate time series and is dominated by the neoclassical model in terms of non-nested test criteria. Cohort drift found in estimated parameters is consistent with the expansion of pronatal social programs. The estimated neoclassical model produces strong short-run responses of birth rates to wages and incomes of the sort that have been found in the time-series literature on fertility while generating the relatively weak long-run responses to economic variables found in the cross-sectional literature on completed fertility.",James J.

The approach emphasizes the equilibrium value set and the static optimization problems embedded in extremal equilibria. A succession of propositions, central among which is ""self-generation,"" allow properties of constrained efficient supergame equilibria to be deduced from the solutions of the static problems. We show that the latter include solutions having a ""bang-bang"" property; this affords a significant simplification of the equilibria that need be considered. These results apply to a broad class of asymmetric games, thereby generalizing our earlier work on optimal cartel equilibria. The bang-bang theorem is strengthened to a necessity result: under certain conditions, efficient sequential equilibria have the property that after every history, the value to players of the remainder of the equilibrium must be an extreme point of the equilibrium value set. General implications of the self-generation and bang-bang propositions include a proof of the monotonicity of the equilibrium average value set in the discount factor, and an iterative procedure for computing the value set.","Dilip Abreu, David Pearce and Ennio Stacchetti",Dilip Abreu,David Pearce,Ennio Stacchetti,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The original Roy model, based on the assumption that log skills are normally distributed, is shown to imply that pursuit of comparative advantage in a free market reduces earnings inequality compared to the earnings distribution that would result if workers were randomly assigned to sectors. Aggregate log earnings are right skewed even if one sectoral distribution is left skewed. Most major implications of the log normal Roy model survive if differences in skills are log concave. However few implications of the model survive if skills are generated from more general distributions. We consider the identifiability of the Roy model from data on earnings distributions. The normal theory version is identifiable without regressors or exclusion restrictions. Sectoral distributions can be identified knowing only the aggregate earnings distribution. For general skill distributions, the model is not identified and has no empirical content. With sufficient price variation, the model can be identified from multimarket data.

The least squares estimator is studied in detail, and we find that it achieves good tail performance under strictly Gaussian conditions. However, the tail performance of the least-squares estimator is found to be extremely poor in the case of heavy-tailed error distributions. Further analysis of the least-squares estimator with light-tailed errors indicates the strong influence of the design matrix in determining tail performance. Turning to the tail behavior of various robust estimators of the parameters of the linear model, we focus on tail performance under heavy (algebraic) tailed errors. The <tex-math>$l_{1}\text{-estimator}$</tex-math> is seen to be a leading case: we find a simple characterization of its tail behavior in terms of the design configuration and show that a broad class of M-estimators have the same performance. Perhaps most significantly, it is shown that our finite-sample measure of tail performance is, for heavy tailed error distributions, essentially the same as the finite sample concept of breakdown point introduced by Donoho and Huber (1983). This finding provides an important probabilistic interpretation of the breakdown point and clarifies the role of tail behavior as a quantitative measure of robustness. This link is further explored for high-breakdown regression estimators including Rousseeuw's (1984) least-median-of-squares estimator.","Xuming He, Jana Jurečková, Roger Koenker and Stephen Portnoy",Xuming He,Jana Jurečková,Roger Koenker,Stephen Portnoy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The equilibrium model is contrasted in terms of its fit to the data with an unrestricted version of the model which is based on a mixture of negative binomial distributions. The equilibrium model fails to conform to the data in exactly the dimension of its major focus, namely it implies that measurement error accounts for almost all of the dispersion in observed wages. The equilibrium model also does not do well in fitting the unemployment duration distribution compared to the unrestricted model. The problem is that the duration distribution itself does not support the existence of significant heterogeneity, as evidenced by the estimates of the unrestricted model.

Nonparametric methods provide a way of avoiding this difficulty. Here it is shown that nonparametric estimates of the optimal instruments can give asymptotically efficient instrumental variables estimators. Also, ways of choosing the nonparametric estimate in applications are discussed. Two types of nonparametric estimates of the optimal instruments are considered.

More generally, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for existence whenever the strategy profile asks agents to reveal all private knowledge relevant to their beliefs about the center's information.

Workers sell their endowments of labor on a Walrasian labor market. Labor is used in production, the output of which flows into inventories. Capitalists consume directly out of their own inventories and use remaining inventories in a retail market. The retail market is characterized by random sequential search with prices set by capitalists on a take-it or leave-it basis. Workers thus receive a continuous flow of wages and spend money in discrete jumps at times set by a Poisson process. The equilibrium distribution of money holdings is the asymptotic steady state of this stochastic process. The economy has a unique uniform price steady state equilibrium. The more rapid the search process in the retail market the higher the absolute retail price and wage, and the higher the real wage. The instantaneous effect of an equal per capita infusion of money is to raise the price, wage, real wage, and transactions rate.

Careful examination of intra-daily exchange rates provides a test of two hypotheses--heat waves and meteor showers.

Alternatively, the meteor shower is a phenomenon of intra-daily volatility spillovers from one market to the next. Using the GARCH model to specify the heteroskedasticity across intra-daily market segments, we find that the empirical evidence is generally against the null hypothesis of the heat wave. Using a volatility type of vector autoregression we examine the impact of news in one market on the time path of per-hour volatility in other markets.","Robert F.

It posits, estimates, and tests a model where the equilibrium behavior of agents sometimes leads them to locate on the boundary of their respective choice sets. The key to our framework is a simple factor structure which characterizes the effects of market forces on household choices and returns to financial assets. It can be rationalized by the two assumptions that household allocations are Pareto optimal and that the labor market is competitive. If markets were complete, then the factors would represent real wages to standardized labor, prices for the future contingent claims which are ultimately realized, and the marginal utilities of wealth to households. Our empirical work estimates household preferences and tests how well this parsimonious factor structure represents panel data on married couples and time series data on asset returns. Most of our estimates are roughly comparable to those found in previous work; we find no evidence against the simple factor representation, and cannot reject the intertemporal capital asset pricing model.",Sumru Altug and Robert A.

We focus here on the benefits usually associated with long-term commitment, namely the efficiency costs involved when long-term contracts are not available. We prove that renegotiable short-term contracts will implement the long-term optimum in a multi-period principal-agent framework when transfers are not too limited, objectives are conflicting, and there is no relevant asymmetric information at the contracting dates. This last assumption excludes adverse selection models, but not repeated moral hazard models when technologies and preferences are time separable.",Patrick Rey and Bernard Salanie,Patrick Rey,Bernard Salanie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Under reasonable conditions the monopolist has an incentive to precommit to its unit price in order to induce its customers to increase their investment, and thereby their demand for the upstream product. Now suppose that the monopolist is privately informed of its unit costs after the downstream firms invest. The monopolist now chooses among contingent contracts, in which price is conditioned on announced costs. We demonstrate that the optimal contract specifies a maximum (""list"") price, which is charged for a significant subset of cost realizations, but which may be discounted (to ""transactions"" prices) when costs are low. The model therefore rationalizes transactions/list pricing: a mode of pricing that is prevalent in interfirm trade. We also use our results to explain why Stigler and Kindahl's medium-term price series tracked the associated Wholesale Price Indices whenever the latter were nondecreasing, but otherwise fell significantly faster.",Daniel J.

Subgame perfect equilibria exist that support quite collusive prices even though each firm's price depends only upon its rival's current price. We find two types of equilibria. One, which we call ""disciplined,"" arise when products are close substitutes. The other, which we call ""spontaneous,"" emerge when products are more differentiated. In disciplined equilibria the steady-state price is enforced by the implicit threat to respond to a price cut with further price cutting. In spontaneous equilibria no such threat is needed. Consumers in the smaller market tend to pay a higher price, as do consumers in the market served by the more efficient firm. The price supported by a disciplined equilibrium is greater the less differentiated are the products.",Jonathan Eaton and Maxim Engers,Jonathan Eaton,Maxim Engers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Empirical evidence indicates that decision makers do not always behave in accordance with the reduction of compound lotteries axiom, but it seems that they satisfy a compound independence axiom (also known as the certainty equivalent mechanism). It turns out that although the reduction and the compound independence axioms together with continuity imply expected utility theory, each of them by itself is compatible with all possible preference relations over simple lotteries. By using these axioms I analyze three different versions of expected utility for two-stage lotteries. The second part of the paper is devoted to possible replacements of the reduction axiom. For this I suggest several different compound dominance axioms. These axioms compare two-stage lotteries by the probability they assign to the upper and lower sets of all simple lotteries X. (For a simple lottery X, its upper (lower) set is the set of lotteries that dominate (are dominated by) X by first order stochastic dominance.) It turns out that these axioms are all strictly weaker than the reduction of compound lotteries axiom. The main theoretical results of this part are: (1) an axiomatic basis for expected utility theory that does not require the reduction axiom and (2) a new axiomatization of the anticipated utility model (also known as expected utility with rank-dependent probabilities). These representation theorems indicate that to a certain extent the rank dependent probabilities model is a natural extension of expected utility theory. Finally, I show that some paradoxes in expected utility theory can be explained, provided one is willing to use the compound independence rather than the reduction axiom.",Uzi Segal,Uzi Segal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Positive (negative) complementarity in consumer preferences promotes downward (upward) bias in the futures price viewed as a predictor of the later spot price. I demonstrate that the conclusion derived from partial equilibrium analysis--that when speculators are risk averse, risk premia are a function of hedging pressure--fails in the general equilibrium analysis, so long as there are no transaction costs. A counterexample is analyzed in which, as consumers' additive logarithmic preferences are varied, producers' hedging positions change from long to short, while the futures risk premium remains unchanged. However, hedging pressure is reinstated as a force influencing risk premia in the sense that the futures price is downward biased when hedgers take short positions and is upward biased when hedgers take long positions, provided it can be assumed (as is usually valid) that fixed setup costs of trading deter consumers more than producers from participating in the futures market.",David Hirshleifer,David Hirshleifer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Given an exact confidence set for the autocorrelation coefficient, we describe how to obtain a similar simultaneous confidence set for the autocorrelation coefficient and any subvector of regression coefficients. Conservative confidence sets for the regression coefficients are then deduced by a projection method. For any hypothesis that specifies jointly the value of the autocorrelation coefficient and any set of linear restrictions on the regression coefficients, we get exact similar tests. For testing linear hypotheses about the regression coefficients only, we suggest bounds-type procedures. Exact confidence sets for the autocorrelation coefficient are built by ""inverting"" autocorrelation tests.

The durable good is illiquid in that a transaction cost must be paid when the good is sold. It is shown that optimal consumption is not a smooth function of wealth; it is optimal for the consumer to wait until a large change in wealth occurs before adjusting his consumption. As a consequence, the consumption based capital asset pricing model fails to hold. Nevertheless, it is shown that the standard, one factor, market portfolio based capital asset pricing model does hold in this environment. It is shown that the optimal durable level is characterized by three numbers (not random variables), say x, y, and z (where <latex>$x < y < z$</latex>). The consumer views the ratio of consumption to wealth (c/W) as his state variable. If this ratio is between x and z, then he does not sell the durable. If c/W is less than x or greater than z, then he sells his durable and buys a new durable of size S so that S/W = y. Thus y is his ""target"" level of c/W. If the stock market moves up enough so that c/W falls below x, then he sells his small durable to buy a larger durable. However, there will be many changes in the value of his wealth for which c/W stays between x and z, and thus consumption does not change. Numerical simulations show that small transactions costs can make consumption changes occur very infrequently. Further, the effect of consumption transactions costs on the demand for risky assets is substantial.",Sanford J. Grossman and Guy Laroque,Sanford J.

These tests involve procedures that are designed to detect the presence of a unit root in the residuals of (cointegrating) regressions among the levels of economic time series. Attention is given to the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test that is recommended by Engle-Granger (1987) and the Z<sub>α</sub> and Z<sub>t</sub> unit root tests recently proposed by Phillips (1987). Two new tests are also introduced, one of which is invariant to the normalization of the cointegrating regression. All of these tests are shown to be asymptotically similar and simple representations of their limiting distributions are given in terms of standard Brownian motion. The ADF and Z<sub>t</sub> tests are asymptotically equivalent. Power properties of the tests are also studied. The analysis shows that all the tests are consistent if suitably constructed but that the ADF and Z<sub>t</sub> tests have slower rates of divergence under cointegration than the other tests. This indicates that, at least in large samples, the Z<sub>α</sub> test should have superior power properties. The paper concludes by addressing the larger issue of test formulation. Some major pitfalls are discovered in procedures that are designed to test a null of cointegration (rather than no cointegration). These defects provide strong arguments against the indiscriminate use of such test formulations and support the continuing use of residual based unit root tests. A full set of critical values for residual based tests is included. These allow for demeaned and detrended data and cointegrating regressions with up to five variables.",P. C. B. Phillips and S.

Such a strategy allows a firm to adapt better to the uncertain environment than either setting a fixed price or setting a fixed quantity; commitment to a supply function may be accomplished in practice by the choice of the firm's size and structure, its culture and values, and the incentive systems and decision rules for its employees. In the absence of uncertainty, there exists an enormous multiplicity of equilibria in supply functions, but uncertainty, by forcing each firm's supply function to be optimal against a range of possible residual demand curves, dramatically reduces the set of equilibria. Under uncertainty, we prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium in supply functions for a symmetric oligopoly producing a homogeneous good and give sufficient conditions for uniqueness. We perform comparative statics with respect to firms' costs, the industry demand, the nature of the demand uncertainty, and the number of firms, and sketch the extension to differentiated products. Firms' equilibrium supply functions are steeper with marginal cost curves that are steeper relative to demand, fewer firms, more highly differentiated products, and demand uncertainty that is relatively greater at higher prices. The steeper are the supply functions firms choose in equilibrium, the more closely competition resembles the Cournot model (which exogenously imposes vertical supply functions--fixed quantities); with flatter equilibrium supply functions, competition is closer to the Bertrand model (which exogenously imposes horizontal supply functions--fixed prices).",Paul D.

The interest is that we allow under both the null and alternative hypotheses for the presence of a one-time change in the level or in the slope of the trend function. We show how standard tests of the unit root hypothesis against trend stationary alternatives cannot reject the unit root hypothesis if the true data generating mechanism is that of stationary fluctuations around a trend function which contains a one-time break. This holds even asymptotically. We derive test statistics which allow us to distinguish the two hypotheses when a break is present. Their limiting distribution is established and selected percentage points are tabulated. We apply these tests to the Nelson-Plosser data set and to the postwar quarterly real GNP series. In the former, the break is due to the 1929 crash and takes the form of a sudden change in the level of the series. For 11 out of the 14 series analyzed by Nelson and Plosser we can reject at a high confidence level the unit root hypothesis. In the case of the postwar quarterly real GNP series, the break in the trend function occurs at the time of the oil price shock (1973) and takes the form of a change in the slope. Here again we can reject the null hypothesis of a unit root. If one is ready to postulate that the 1929 crash and the slowdown in growth after 1973 are not realizations of an underlying time-invariant stochastic process but can be modeled as exogenous, then the conclusion is that most macroeconomic time series are not characterized by the presence of a unit root.

We show how a normalized version of the density-weighted average derivatives can be estimated by certain linear instrumental variables coefficients. Both of the estimators are computationally simple, root-N-consistent and asymptotically normal; their statistical properties do not rely on functional form assumptions on the regression function or the distribution of the data. The estimators, based on sample analogues of the product moment representation of the average derivative, are constructed using nonparametric kernel estimators of the density of the regressors. Asymptotic normality is established using extensions of classical U-statistic theorems, and asymptotic bias is reduced through use of a higher-order kernel. Consistent estimators of the asymptotic variance-covariance matrices of the estimators are given, and a limited Monte Carlo simulation is used to study the practical performance of the procedures.","James L.

This article investigates the extent to which specification error can explain these rejections. The empirical strategy is limited information maximum likelihood in conjunction with seminonparametric (expanding parameter space) representations for both the law of motion and utility. We find that consumption growth and asset returns display conditional heterogeneity, but this fact does not account for rejection of the overidentifying restrictions as might be anticipated from the work of Hansen, Singleton, and others using generalized method of moments methods. We also find that expansion of the parameter space in the direction of nonseparable utility causes the overidentifying restrictions to be accepted. Our estimation strategy provides information on the manner in which the restrictions distort the law of motion. In particular, imposition of additively separable, constant relative risk aversion utility causes the conditional variance of consumption growth to be overpredicted, the conditional covariance of asset returns with consumption growth to be overpredicted, and an equity premium. Imposition of nonseparable seminonparametric utility causes distortion in these same directions, though the distortions are much smaller which is consistent with the outcomes of the tests of the restrictions.",A.

We then suggest replacing the sure-thing principle, which may be used to axiomatize a weighted average functional, by a weaker version of it. Using the weakened axiom in Schmeidler's nonadditive measure model (reinterpreted for the multi-period context) yields an axiomatization of a larger class of decision rules which are representable by a weighted average of the utility in each period and the utility variation between each two consecutive periods. The weighted average assumption is a special case of the generalized model, a case in which the decision maker is variation neutral. Similarly, we define and characterize variation aversion and variation liking, and show an example of the economic implications of these properties.",Itzhak Gilboa,Itzhak Gilboa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

In this paper, we take the view that continuous time can be viewed as ""discrete time, but with a grid that is infinitely fine."" Specifically, we define a class of continuous-time strategies with the following property: when restricted to an arbitrary, increasingly fine sequence of discrete-time grids, any profile of strategies drawn from this class generates a convergent sequence of outcomes, whose limit is independent of the sequence of grids. We then define the continuous-time outcome to be this limit. Because our continuous-time model conforms so closely to the conventional discrete-time model, we can readily compare the predictions of the two frameworks. Specifically, we ask two questions. First, is discrete-time with a very find grid a good proxy for continuous time? Second, does every subgame perfect equilibrium in our model have a discrete-time analog? Our answer to the first question is the following ""upper hemi-continuity"" result: Suppose a sequence of discrete-time ε-subgame-perfect equilibria increasingly closely approximates (in a special sense) a given continuous-time profile, with ε converging to zero along as the period length shrinks. Then the continuous-time profile will be an exact equilibrium for the corresponding continuous-time game.Our second answer is a lower hemi-continuity result that holds under weak conditions. Fix a perfect equilibrium for a continuous-time game and a positive ε. Then for any sufficiently fine grid, there will exist an ε-subgame perfect equilibrium for the corresponding game played on that grid which ""is within ε of"" the continuous-time equilibrium. Our model yields sharp predictions in a variety of industrial organization applications. We first consider several variants of a familiar preemption model. Next, we analyze a stylized model of a patent race. Finally, we obtain a striking uniqueness result for a class of ""repeated"" games.",Leo K. Simon and Maxwell B. Stinchcombe,Leo K. Simon,Maxwell B.

The theoretical section gives conditions under which consumption and wealth will decline with age. An important determinant is a boundary condition on the consumption path caused by annuities. Using panel data from the Retirement History Survey on the wealth of the retired elderly, I estimate the parameters of the model, which are the degree of mortality risk aversion, the subjective time rate of discount, and the marginal utility of bequests. The estimation method involves solving for the optimal consumption trajectory from the first-order conditions of the dynamic optimization, and from the boundary conditions. The results indicate that the consumption path is sensitive to variations in mortality rates, meaning that mortality risk aversion is moderate, and certainly much smaller than what is typically assumed in the literature. The marginal utility of bequests is small; therefore, desired bequests, which are estimated from model simulations, are small on average. Apparently most bequests are accidental, the result of uncertainty about the date of death. The parameter estimates imply that although consumption and wealth paths may rise at early ages, eventually they will fall as mortality rates become large. Falling wealth with age is confirmed in the raw data: average wealth holdings of the elderly decline with age, and the majority of individuals dissave as they age.",Michael D. Hurd,Michael D.

Random utility models are appealing since they allow the usual assumption of deterministic utility maximizing behavior by each consumer to co-exist with the apparent randomness across individuals which is exhibited by data. Our results show that the use of random utility models implies that the disturbances of the demand equations may not be homoskedastic but must be functions of prices and/or income. If the demand system is generated by random utility maximization, then empirical studies of demand which have assumed homeskedastic disturbances will suffer the usual inferential difficulties. A possible explanation for the common rejection of demand theory axioms in applied work, therefore, is provided by the fact that most previous demand studies have, in fact, assumed homoskedasticity. A sampling experiment provides some evidence that ignoring the heteroskedasticity leads to an incorrect test size for a test of symmetry. Heteroskedastic-consistent tests are compared to the usual tests. At least one is found to work reasonably well in small samples in the presence of heteroskedasticity.",Bryan W.

One purpose of the present work is to prove the fruitfulness of the following estimation strategy: use Monte-Carlo simulations to compute the first and second order moments of the endogenous variables, and maximize a resulting pseudo likelihood function to estimate the parameters. We first describe the PML method in the context of the so-called canonical disequilibrium model. We then apply it to a small aggregated macroeconomic model previously studied under FIML by Artus, Avouyi-Dovi, Laroque (1985), where we allow for a disaggregation into micro markets. The results we obtain are strikingly similar to theirs. This both demonstrates in this example the robustness of the FIML procedure to the introduction of micro markets and stresses the usefulness of the PML method in obtaining reliable estimates at a smaller cost.",Guy Laroque and Bernard Salanie,Guy Laroque,Bernard Salanie,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The Grunfeld-Griliches prediction criterion for choosing between aggregate and disaggregate equations is generalized to allow for contemporaneous covariances between the disturbances of micro equations and the possibility of different parametric restrictions on the equations of the disaggregate model. A new test is proposed of the hypothesis of `perfect aggregation' which tests the validity of aggregation either through coefficient equality or through the stability over time of the composition of the regressors across the micro units. The tools developed in the paper are then applied to employment demand functions for the UK economy disaggregated by 40 industries. Firstly a set of unrestricted log-linear dynamic specifications are estimated for the disaggregate equations and then linear parameter restrictions are imposed as appropriate. Corresponding unrestricted and restricted aggregate equations are estimated. Two different levels of aggregation are considered: aggregation over the 23 manufacturing industries and aggregation over all 40 industries of the economy. In both cases the hypothesis of perfect aggregation is firmly rejected. For the manufacturing industries the prediction criterion marginally favors the aggregate equation but over all industries the disaggregated equations are strongly preferred.,"M. H. Pesaran, R. G.

Computable functions are defined, as in the computer science literature, as functions whose values can be calculated using some finite algorithm. The paper examines two learning environments. In the first, agents have perfect information about the state of nature. In this case, the theory of machine inference can be applied to show that there is a broad class of computable economies whose rational expectations equilibria can be learned by inductive inference. In the second environment, agents do not have perfect information about the state of nature. In this case, a version of Gödel's incompleteness theorem applicable to the theory of computable functions yields the conclusion that rational expectations equilibria cannot be learned.",Stephen E.

An important feature of these general preferences is that they permit risk attitudes to be disentangled from the degree of intertemporal substitutability. Moreover, in an infinite horizon, representative agent context these preference specifications lead to a model of asset returns in which appropriate versions of both the atemporal CAPM and the intertemporal consumption-CAPM are nested as special cases. In our general model, systematic risk of an asset is determined by covariance with both the return to the market portfolio and consumption growth, while in each of the existing models only one of these factors plays a role. This result is achieved despite the homotheticity of preferences and the separability of consumption and portfolio decisions. Two other auxiliary analytical contributions which are of independent interest are the proofs of (i) the existence of recursive intertemporal utility functions, and (ii) the existence of optima to corresponding optimization problems. In proving (i), it is necessary to define a suitable domain for utility functions. This is achieved by extending the formulation of the space of temporal lotteries in Kreps and Porteus (1978) to an infinite horizon framework. A final contribution is the integration into a temporal setting of a broad class of a temporal non-expected utility theories. For homogeneous members of the class due to Chew (1985) and Dekel (1986), the corresponding intertemporal asset pricing model is derived.",Larry G. Epstein and Stanley E. Zin,Larry G.

Under these assumptions we show the existence of a unique price equilibrium in the duopoly case where firms must offer intervals of qualities. At all price equilibria in which both firms make a positive profit, discrimination of consumers is incomplete. When the firms choose their product lines they are influenced by two opposite effects. Discrimination among heterogeneous buyers requires a broad quality range. On the contrary, price competition lowers profit margins on neighboring qualities sold by different firms, creating the Chamberlinian incentive for a firm to differentiate its products from those of its competitors. We show that the second effect dominates the first for intermediate qualities: at a Nash equilibrium of the quality game where each firm makes a positive profit, there is always a gap between the two product lines.",Paul Champsaur and Jean-Charles Rochet,Paul Champsaur,Jean-Charles Rochet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The tests are directional and are derived successively for the cases where the competing models are non-nested, overlapping, or nested and whether both, one, or neither is misspecified. As a prerequisite, we fully characterize the asymptotic distribution of the likelihood ratio statistic under the most general conditions. We show that it is a weighted sum of chi-square distribution or a normal distribution depending on whether the distributions in the competing models closest to the truth are observationally identical. We also propose a test of this latter condition.",Quang H. Vuong,Quang H. Vuong,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The parameters of an autoregression are viewed as the outcome of a discrete-state Markov process. For example, the mean growth rate of a nonstationary series may be subject to occasional, discrete shifts. The econometrician is presumed not to observe these shifts directly, but instead must draw probabilistic inference about whether and when they may have occurred based on the observed behavior of the series. The paper presents an algorithm for drawing such estimation of population parameters by the method of maximum likelihood and provides the foundation for forecasting future values of the series. An empirical application of this technique to postwar U.S. real GNP suggests that the periodic shift from a positive growth rate to a negative growth rate is a recurrent feature of the U.S. business cycle, and indeed could be used as an objective criterion for defining and measuring economic recessions. The estimated parameter values suggest that a typical economic recession is associated with a 3% permanent drop in the level of GNP.",James D. Hamilton,James D.

Perhaps surprisingly, the evidence clearly indicates that the cashout of the stamps had no detectable influence on food expenditures.

In the second part of the paper we offer an interpretation of this model in terms of a simple life-cycle labor supply model. On the assumption that we can identify individualproductivity growth with the shared component of earnings and hours variation, we obtain estimates of the intertemporal substitution elasticity.

Part I shows that there exists a not legally enforceable. Part I shows that there exists a variety of self-enforcing implicit contracts, modelled as perfect equilibria in a repeated game, and characterizes all the wage and performance outcomes that can be implemented. Implementation requires a strictly positive surplus from employment, the form of the contract depending on how this surplus is divided between firm and employee. Piece-rate contracts, and contracts with an informally agreed bonus, can be made self-enforcing but the use of severance pay and bonding does not extend the set of implementable allocations. The resulting contracts resemble actual labor contracts more than do the contracts in standard principal-agent models. Part II analyses market equilibrium with these contracts, also modelled as perfect equilibria in a repeated game, and shows that many such equilibria exist. Unfilled vacancies and unemployed workers can co-exist despite the existence of contracts that are potentially mutually beneficial. For those jobs that are filled, any division of the potential surplus is possible so that the market can have, at the same time, involuntary unemployment and vacancies that are unfilled depsite filled jobs earning positive profits. As a criterion for selecting equilibria, a notion of renogotiation proofness is is applied. Then either all workers are employed or all jobs filled but any division of the potential surplus is still possible. The paper explores what further restrictions on beliefs give rise to a Walrasian outcome, in which all the potential surplus goes to the short side of the market, and to an efficiency wage type outcome, in which the potential surplus goes to the long side.",W.

A unique (Markov) perfect equilibrium is shown to exist, and is fully characterized. It generally involves a phase of mixed strategies, during which the seller tries to deter speculation by injecting uncertainty into its price dynamics, while speculators store in increasing numbers, with possibly a final ""run"" on the good. The stochastic price policies of a large number of such firms are shown to aggregate back to a price index growing at the rate of general inflation in response to which they arose. The model thus establishes that: (a) a constant rate of aggregate inflation can at the same time generate and cover up significant uncertainty and social costs at the microeconomic level; (b) speculation can be destabilizing and socially wastful, even in the absence of shocks and imperfect information. Most importantly, they provide a theoretical foundation for the frequently encountered claim that inflation causes price uncertainty.",Roland Bénabou,Roland Bénabou,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The equilibrium concept employed is Bayesian Nash equilibrium and the notion of implemantation is full implementation, which is stronger than the more commonly employed notion of truthful implementation. An allocation rule is truthfully implementable if there exists a direct mechanism to which truth telling is an equilibrium and which yields the allocation rule as its truthful equilibrium outcome. An allocation rule is fully implementable if there exists mechanism which yields the allocation rule as its unique equilibrium outcome. More generally, a set of allocation rules, or a social choice set, is fully implementable if there exist a mechanism whose equilibrium outcomes coincide with the set. This stronger notion of implemention avoids the well known problems of multiple equilibria which arise in direct revelation games. We develop a condition, termed Bayesian monotonicity, which we show is necessary for full implementation. An incentive compatibility condition is also necessary. We prove that Bayesian monotonicity and a slightly stronger incentive compatibility condition are sufficient for full implementation when there are at least three agents. We present several examples of allocation rules which do and do not satisfy our condition. One example is that of an allocation rule which is fully inplementable by an indirect mechanism, but for which every equivalent direct mechanism has multiple equilibrium outcomes.",Thomas R.

The complexity of a strategy is measured by the number of states in the automaton used to play the strategy. We analyze Nash equilibrium in the ""machine game."" Strong necessary conditions on the structure of equilibrium machine pairs are derived, under general assumptions about how players trade off repeated game payoffs against implementation costs. These structural results in turn place significant restrictions on equilibrium payoffs. We provide a complete characterization for symmetric 2 x 2 stage games, when repeated game payoffs are evaluated according to the limit of means, and complexity costs enter preferences lexicographically.

Suppose that some (one-dimensional) stochastic process S provides a sufficient statistic for aggregate consumption. Then a (heuristic) dynamic programming argument shows that S, market wealth, and the wealth derivative of the value function (for any agent) are all locally perfectly correlated. It follows from Merton's work that there is a linear relationship between the local mean return on a security and the local covariance of that return with the return on the market portfolio. The formal development uses martingale representation and martingale projection to obtain an intertemporal CAPM; the history of a scalar Brownian motion plays the role of a sufficient statistic. We motivate the assumption of a sufficient statistic for aggregate consumption by considering a countable set of securities whose payoffs have an approximate factor structure, where the factor components are in the information set generated by an N-dimensional Brownian motion and the idiosyncratic components are weakly correlated. The approximate factor structure on the security payoffs implies that the rates of return have (locally) an approximate factor structure.

In such cases, Varian's results imply that no production possibility set containing all observations can rationalize the observed data. We identify each firm whose performance, given the prices faced by it, may be found consistent with profit maximization relative to some production possibility set containing all observed output-input vectors. We show that the set E of all such firms can itself be weakly rationalized in the sense that there exists a (closed, convex, and ""monotone"") production possibility set that contains all the observations, and relative to which the performance of all the firms in the set E is consistent with profit maximization given their respective prices. By definition, firms not included in this largest set E of efficient observations unambiguously deviate from profit maximizing behavior for any production possibility set containing all observations. We follow Farrell (1957) and analyze these deviations into technical and allocative efficiency measures, considering as admissible all closed, convex, and ""monotone"" production possibility sets relative to which the performance of each firm in the set E remains consistent with profit maximization. We then describe nonparametric methods for determining the tightest upper and lower bounds on the technical, allocative, and aggregate efficiency measures evaluated relative to all such admissible production possibility sets. It is seen that the tightest upper bound on the technical efficiency measure is the same as the value computed by the nonparametric efficiency evaluation technique known as data envelopment analysis, thus establishing a link between this literature in management science/operations research and the nonparametric production analysis in economics.",Rajiv D.

In both cases, adjustments to the asymptotic critical values are found to insure that the tests have correct size to a second order of approximation. Approximate local power functions are derived for the size-adjusted tests and the power loss due to the estimation of @s is calculated. The second-order adjustments to the asymptotic distributions are relatively simple, but depend on the particular functional form for @s(@Q). Two examples, one involving heteroscedasticity and the other autocorrelation, are worked out in detail. These examples suggest that the size and power correction terms can be large even in very simple models where asymptotic theory might be expected to work well. It appears that the null rejection probabilities of the commonly proposed robust regression tests are often considerably greater than their nominal level. Moreover, the cost of not k@s can sometimes be substantial.",Thomas J. Rothenberg,Thomas J. Rothenberg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Such processes help us to work towards a general asymptotic theory of regression for multiple time series in which some series may be integrated processes of the ARIMA type, others may be stable ARMA processes with near unit roots, and yet others may be mildly explosive. A limit theory for the sample moments of such time series is developed using weak convergence and is shown to involve simple functionals of a vector diffusion. The results suggest finite sample approximations which in the stationary case correspond to conventional central limit theory. The theory is applied to the study of vector autoregressions and cointegrating regressions of the type recently advanced by Engle and Granger (1987). A noncentral limiting distribution theory is derived for some recently proposed multivariate unit root tests. This yields some interesting insights into the asymptotic power properties of the various tests. Models with drift and near-integration are also studied. The asymptotic theory in this case helps to bridge the gap between the nonnormal asymptotics obtained by Phillips and Durlauf (1986) for regressions with integrated regressors and the normal asymptotics that usually apply in regressions with deterministic regressors.",P.

Fourteen of twenty-two experiments exhibit price bubbles followed by crashes relative to intrinsic dividend value. When traders are experienced this reduces, but does not eliminate, the probability of a bubble. The regression of changes in mean price on lagged excess bids (number of bids minus the number of offers in the previous period), P""t - P""t-1 = @a = @b(B""t""-""1 - O""t""-""1), supports the hypothesis that -@a = E(d), the one-period expected value of the dividend, and that @b > O, where excess bids is a surrogate measure of excess demand arising from homegrown capital gains (losses) expectations.

The principal offers a first period incentive scheme and observes some measure of the agent's first-period performance (cost or profit), which depends on the agent's ability and (unobservable) first-period effort. The relationship is entirely run by short-term contracts. In the second period the principal updates the incentive scheme and the agent is free to accept the new incentive scheme or to quit. The strategies are required to be perfect, and updating of the principal's beliefs about the agent's ability follows Bayes' rule. The central theme of the paper is that the ratchet effect leads to much pooling in the first period. First, for any first-period incentive scheme, there exists no separating equilibrium. Second, when the uncertainty about the agent's ability is small, the optimal scheme must involve a large amount of pooling.

Moreover, the mechanism need have no more than three stages. To illustrate the power of this approach, we discuss a number of models in which it is possible to implement the first-best (although it would have been impossible to do so without using stage mechanisms). The diversity of these models suggests that subgame perfect implementation may find wide application: public goods, contracts, agency theory, constitution design. In several cases, the mechanisms we present have the added attraction that agents' moves are sequential, not simultaneous.

To motivate our analysis, we argue that intransitivities and preference cycles deserve serious consideration in normative theories of preference and choice. Examples from decision making under certainty, risk, and uncertainty are used to suggest that there are simply too many settings in which intelligent people and groups can have good reasons for cyclic preferences to exclude intransitivities from normative theory. Our analysis of decision processes enriches the basic alternative set by probabilistic convexification, as in the formation of mixed strategies in game theory. It is noted (and has been known for 30 years) for one-stage processes that if the convex set is finitely generated then it can have an enriched alternative that is maximally preferred regardless of intransitivities among basic alternatives. The core of the paper focuses on two-stage processes, typified by the Bayesian formulation of a choice of experiment followed by selection of a terminal act once the experiment's outcome is observed. We suppress consideration of Bayes's theorem and other facets of specialized formulations of two-stage processes to concentrate on a general treatment in which the ""holistic,"" single-stage choice procedure is compared with two sequential procedures that first choose among different subsets and then choose something from the selected subset. The sequential procedures, referred to as ""naive"" and ""sophisticated,"" base the choice of subset on a natural extension of holistic preferences. Many combinations of these three procedures are available in settings involving at least three stages of choice. A main result of the comparative analysis is that, when convex sets are finitely generated, the three choice procedures all have unambiguous solutions and these solutions can differ radically when preferences are intransitive. On the other hand, they coincide when preferences are fully transitive, and this can be taken as an argument in favor of transitivity. Moreover, since the imposition of transitivity on our model still allows nonlinearities that violate the von Neumann-Morgenstern utility model, the procedural equivalence obtains for a theory that is more general than their expected utility theory.",Peter C.

In particular, they may be unable to describe the states of the world in enough detail that an outsider (the courts) could later verify which state had occurred, and so the contract will be incomplete. The parties can make up for this incompleteness to some extent bybuilding into the contract a mechanism for revising the terms of trade as they each receive information about benefits and costs. One striking conclusion of our analysis is that because the parties can rescind the original contract and write a new one, severe limitations are placed on the form the revisions can take. Moreover, these limitations depend crucially on what means of communication the parties have at their disposal during the revision process. We characterize an optimal contract in two cases. First, when a contract is being used to facilitate trade between two agents who must undertake relationship-specific investments, it is generally not possible to implement the first-best. Fora a particular example, we are able to confirm the idea that the second-best outcome will involve under-investment. Second, when a contract is being used to share risk, and there are no specific investments, we find that it is possible to implement the first-best provided messages sent between the agents can be publicly verified.",Oliver Hart and John Moore,Oliver Hart,John Moore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

It is well known that without some restriction on preferences, super-majority rules have paradoxical properties.

We introduce a definition of social consensus which involves two restrictions ondomain: one on individual preferences, the other on the distribution of preferences. Individuals vote for the proposal closest (in Euclidean distance) to ther most preferred point. The density of voters' ideal points is concave over its support in R''. Under these conditions, there exists an unbeatable proposal according to 64%-majority rule. In addition, no electoral cycles are possible. For n-dimensional decision problems, the precise majority size necessary to avoid cycles is 1 - (n/n + 1))^n which rises monotonically to 1 - (1/e), just below 64%. Our approach is based on the Simpson-Kramer min-max rule. We compare this rule with Condorcet's original proposal for an electoral system immune to his paradox of votiing.

Even in a competitive market there is a welfare loss with respect to the first best outcome due to incomplete information in general. Nevertheless a competitive market is efficient, taking as given the decentralized private information structure of the economy. Endogenous (and costly) information acquisition is examined and seen to imply that the market outcome always falls short of the first best level with decreasing returns to scale. The results are also shown to be robust to the addition of extra rounds of competition which allows firms to use the information revealed by past prices.

The overall assessment of this model that exists in the literature is quite negative: there is little evidence that manufacturers hold inventories of finished goods in order to smooth production patterns. This paper examines whether this negative assessment of the model is due to one or both of two features: costs shocks and seasonal fluctuations. The reasons forconsidering costs shocks is that, if firms are buffered more by cost shocks thandemand shocks, production should optimally be more variable than sales. The reasons for considering seasonal fluctuations are that seasonal fluctuations areprecisely the kinds of fluctuations that producers should most easily smooth, and that seasonally adjusted data are likely to produce spurious rejections of the production smoothing model even when it is correct. We integrate cost shocks and seasonal fluctuations into the analysis of the production smoothing model in three steps. First, we present a general production smoothing model of inventory investment that is consistent with both seasonal and nonseasonal fluctuations in production, sales, and inventories. Themodel allows for both observable and unobservable changes in marginal costs. Second, we estimate this model using both seasonally adjusted and seasonally unadjusted data plus seasonal dummies. The goal here is to determine whether the incorrect use of seasonally adjusted data has been responsible for the rejections of the production smoothing model reported in previous studies. The third part of our approach is to explicitly examine the seasonal movements in the data. We test whether the residual from an Euler equation is uncorrelated with the seasonal component of contemporaneous sales. Even if unobservable seasonal cost shocks make the seasonal variation in output greater than that in sales, the timing of the resulting seasonal movements in output should not necessarily match that of sales. The results of our empirical work provide a strong negative report on the production smoothing model, even when it includes cost shocks and seasonal fluctuations. At both seasonal and nonseasonal frequencies, there appears to be little evidence that firms hold inventories in order to smooth production. A striking piece of evidence is that in most industries the seasonal in productionclosely matches the seasonal in shipments, even after accounting for the movements in interest rates, input prices, and the weather.",Jeffrey A.

The controversy arises from the difficulty of specifying the model of participant outcomes in the absence of training that is necessary in any nonexperimental program evaluation. In this paper we suggest that some of these difficulties may be overcome by focusing on a very simple measure of outcomes: namely, the probability of employment. We present a variety of estimates of the effect of training on the probability of employment for the 1976 cohort of adult male participants in the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) program. Our methods range from a simple comparison of pre- and post-training employment probabilities between trainees and nonparticipants, to a fully specified first-order Markov model of employment probabilities with individual heterogeneity. There is consistent evidence across methods that CETA participation increased the probability of employment in the three years after training by from 2 to 5 percentage points. Classroom training programs appear to have had significantly larger effects than on-the-job programs, although the estimated effects of both kinds of programs are positive. We also find that movements in and out of employment for trainees and nonparticipants are reasonably well described by a first-order process, conditional on individual heterogeneity. In the context of this model, CETA participation appears to have increased both the probability of moving into employment, and the probability of continuing employment.",David Card and Daniel Sullivan,David Card,Daniel Sullivan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The dynamic programming equations for an MPE are derived. The first application of the model is to a natural monopoly, in which fixed costs are so large that at most one firm can make a profit. The firms install short-run capacity. In the unique symmetric MPE, only one firm is active and practices the quantity analogue of limit pricing.

What is not so widely understood is that these same problems exist when aggregating goods that are efficiently allocated in an economy. For example, suppose there are many types of labor in an economy and each type of labor is efficiently allocated among firms. To form a labor aggregate in the economy requires that certain aggregation restrictions be satisfied; these are the subject of this paper. In this paper, we make two contributions to the literature on aggregating inputs and outputs in economy production functions. First, we present necessary and sufficient conditions for aggregating efficiently allocated goods under general assumptions on the technology. Second, we present a general theorem on the conditions for the existence of aggregates of both efficiently allocated goods and arbitrarily allocated goods. We use this theorem to elucidate the role of efficiency in determining the existence of aggregates.",Charles Blackorby and William Schworm,Charles Blackorby,William Schworm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

In general, an implementing mechanism with the Nash property in messages requires a larger message space than sufficies for decentralized realization without regard to individual incentives. In particular, we study implementation of Walrasian allocations in exchange environments.

For an alternative set of arbitrary size, however, Williams' proof requires an additional restriction on the nature of the alternative set. In this paper, I make improvements in two important aspects of their Nash implementation theorems: a significant reduction in the strategy space and a proof for an arbitrary alternative set. In Maskin's and Williams' game forms, each participant announces a preference profile of all participants and also a socially optimal alternative with respect to the announced preference profile. I prove Maskin's theorem using a much smaller strategy space with respect to the preference announcements. Namely, each participant announces only two participants' preferences (i.e., his own preferences and his successor's preferences), an alternative that is not necessarily optimal, and a positive integer not exceeding the number of participants. With this specification of the strategy space, I confirm the theorem for an arbitrary size of the alternative set.",Tatsuyoshi Saijo,Tatsuyoshi Saijo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Human capital earnings functions are estimated using cross-sectional and longitudinal data from the CPS and QES. The major finding is that the dispersion in wages across industries as measured by the standard deviation in industry wage differentials is substantial. Furthermore, F tests of the joint significance of industry dummy variables are decisively rejected. These differences are very difficult to link to unobserved differences in ability or to compensating differentials for working conditions. Fixed effects models are estimated using two longitudinal data sets to control for constant, unmeasured worker characteristics that might bias cross-sectional estimates. Because measurement error is a serious problem in looking at workers who report changing industries, we use estimates of industry classification error rates to adjust the longitudinal results. In the fixed effects analysis, the industry wage differentials are sizable and are very similar to the cross-sectional estimates. In addition, the fixed effects estimates are robust under a variety of assumptions about classification errors and are similar using both data sets. These findings cast doubt on explanations of industry wage differentials based on unmeasured ability. Additional analysis finds that the industry wage structure is highly correlated for workers in small and large firms, in different regions of the U.S., and with varying job tenures. Finally, evidence is presented demonstrating that turnover has a negative relationship with industry wage differentials. These findings suggest that workers in high wage industries receive noncompetitive rents.",Alan B. Krueger and Lawrence H. Summers,Alan B. Krueger,Lawrence H. Summers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Recent empirical work has identified another potentially more important social cost, for the damage to the pavement raises the operating costs of subsequent vehicles, and these operating costs may be an order of magnitude larger than the road maintenance costs. The paper develops a theory to handle this newly identified externality and establishes a remarkable result. If roads are repaired when they reach a predetermined critical condition (not necessarily optimally set) and if road damage is fully attributable to traffic, then in steady state with zero traffic growth the average road damage externality is zero, and the average marginal social cost of road use is equal to the average road maintenance cost. The result holds for arbitrary road damage and vehicle damage functions. Recent empirical studies reveal that weather accounts for a significant fraction of road deterioration, and in this case the road damage externality is no longer exactly zero, but is quantitatively negligible. The appropriate road user charge now only recovers the fraction of damage attributable to traffic.",David M. Newbery,David M. Newbery,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The supply function allows for intertemporal substitution in response to real wage fluctuations, and the demand function allows for adjustment costs on employment. The supply and demand functions both solve quadratic partial adjustment problems, driven by rational expectations about future real wages. The market equilibrium also solves a partial adjustment problem, driven by rational expectations about future preference and technology shocks. Two related issues are emphasized: the identification of dynamic labor supply and demand functions, and the theoretical interpretation of serial correlation in employment and real wages. When the supply and demand shocks are assumed to be AR(1) processes which are not causally related, the model delivers a simple structure for the equilibrium process for employment and real wages, which is a restricted VAR(2). This simple structure facilitates the interpretation of summary statistics on the time-series properties of observed employment and real wage series. The supply and demand functions can both be (locally) identified using only employment and real wage data.

It introduces a number of concepts which organize the theory in a natural way. These include the idea of an optimal penal code, and the related notions of simple penal codes and simple strategy profiles. I view a strategy profile as a rule specifying an initial path (i.e., an infinite stream of one-period action profiles), and punishments (also paths, and hence infinite streams) for any deviations from the initial path, or from a previously prescribed punishment. An arbitrary strategy profile may involve an infinity of punishments and complex history-dependent prescriptions. The main result of this paper is that much of this potential strategic complexity is redundant: every perfect equilibrium path is the outcome of some perfect simple strategy profile. A simple strategy profile is independent of history in the following strong sense: it specifies the same player specific punishment after any deviation by a particular player. Thus simple strategy profiles have a parsimonious description in terms of (n+1) paths where n is the number of players. Unlike the undiscounted case there is no need to ""make the punishment fit the crime."" In particular, a player who has a ""myopic"" incentive to deviate from his own punishment may be deterred from doing so simply by restarting the punishment already in effect. The key to the above result is that, with discounting, worst perfect equilibria exist for each player. These define an optimal penal code. The notion of a simple penal code yields an elementary proof of the existence of an optimal penal code and leads directly to the theorem on the ""sufficiency"" of simple strategy profiles.",Dilip Abreu,Dilip Abreu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

This measure facilitates the investigation of some issues regarding finite rationality and the structure of subgame perfect equilibria of repeated games with discounting. Specifically, the complexity of a strategy in a given repeated game is defined to be the cardinality of the induced strategy set, i.e., the number of distinct strategies induced by the original strategy in all possible subgames. We observe that this cardinality is equal to the size (cardinality of the state set) of the smallest automaton which can implement the strategy. Thus, in a sense, complexity is measured on the basis of the amount of computing power inherent in the strategy. A measure of strategic memory is also studied. The following results are obtained: (1) combining tow notions of ""bounded rationality"" (epsilon equilibrium and finite complexity), we find that every subgame perfect equilibrium of the repeated game can be approximated (with regard to payoffs) by a subgame perfect epsilon equilibrium of finite complexity. (2) For a generic class of normal form stage games, at every discount robust subgame perfect (DRSP) equilibrium, there are necessary relationships among the complexities and memories of the players' strategies. In the two player case, strategies must be equally complex and must have equal memories. (3) For a second class of two player stage games, we show that the payoff vectors for all DRSP equilibria are obtainable via equilibria in which the players' strategies are equally complex and have equal memories.",Ehud Kalai and William Stanford,Ehud Kalai,William Stanford,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

For a particular utilitarian social welfare function, the problem faced by a central planner can be broken down into two subproblems, a standard problem of optimally allocating aggregate consumption over time and a problem of distributing aggregate consumption optimally at each moment among those alive. If it can use a sufficiently rich set of lump-sum taxes and transfers, the government can replicate the command optimum as a market equilibrium outcome. No issue of government debt is needed to achieve this decentralization. The discussion emphasizes time-inconsistency problems arising from two sources. First, some social welfare functions give rise to time-inconsistent command optimums, for reasons first discussed by Strotz (1956). Second, in a market setting, optimal fiscal policy can be time-inconsistent when the government's fiscal tools are too limited to allow it to decentralize a time-consistent command optimum. This second possibility is illustrated by an sample in which the government is constrained to levy the same lump-sum tax or transfer on everyone alive on a given date. Unless fiscal policy has no influence over factor prices, optimal fiscal policy can be time-inconsistent if the economy's horizon is finite.",Guillermo A. Calvo and Maurice Obstfeld,Guillermo A.

The application of parametric models extends previous research as it applies to a broad range of models including those that are nonlinear in variables and/or parameters. The application to nonparametric models results in a simple necessary condition for identifiability.

Subjects play an abstracted lending game: a B player lends or does not lend; then if B lends, and E player can pay back or renege. The game is played 8 times, and there is a small controlled probability that the E player's induced preferences make him prefer to pay back (but usually he prefers to renege). In sequential equilibrium, even E players who prefer to renege should pay back in early periods of the game, and renege with increasing frequency in later periods, to establish reputations for preferring to pay back. After many repetitions of the 8-period game, actual play is roughly like the sequential equilibrium, except that E players pay back later in the game and more often than they should. This behavior is rational if B players have a ""homemade"" prior probability of .17 (in addition to the controlled probability) that E players will prefer to pay back. We conclude that sequential equilibrium with homemade incomplete information describes actual behavior well enough that it is plausible to apply it to theoretical settings where individuals make choices (e.g., product markets, labor markets, bargaining).",Colin Camerer and Keith Weigelt,Colin Camerer,Keith Weigelt,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The paper studies the distribution of the t statistic for testing the value of the autoregressive parameter when the model is estimated by least squares. The Monte Carlo estimates of the quantiles of the t statistic show that Student's t is not a satisfactory approximation for sample sizes typical in economic applications. The main problem is not the shape of the distribution of the t statistic, but its location. Adjusting the t statistic so that it has the same mean and standard deviation as Student's t, the distribution of this adjusted t statistic is accurately approximated by Student's t. Techniques are presented for accurately approximating the mean and standard deviation of the t statistic such that the adjusted t statistic can be readily calculated in practice. The analysis is extended in two directions. The first is to examine the effect of introducing an exogenous variable into the basic model. In the expanded model Student's t also accurately approximates the distribution of the t statistic for testing the autoregressive parameter and for testing the coefficient of the exogenous variable after these t statistics are adjusted for mean and standard deviation. The problem of obtaining a feasible adjustment procedure is that the moments of these t statistics now depend on nuisance parameters. The second is to examine the robustness of the results in the basic model to several nonnormal error distributions. For each nonnormal distribution the t statistic is adjusted using the mean and standard deviation appropriate for the case of normal errors and then the distribution of the modified t statistic is compared with that of Student's t.",J.

We report on a series of experiments examining three key implications of these auctions: (i) in a first-price auction, public information about rivals' values increases expected revenue, (ii) an English auction increases expected revenue compared to a first-price auction, and (iii) a second-price auction is isomorphic to an English auction. In examining these issues, we compare predictions of some ad hoc bidding models with Nash equilibrium predictions. In the first-price auction experiments, Nash equilibrium bidding theory organizes the data better than either of two ad hoc bidding models. Public information about others' valuations does increase average revenue, but the increase in revenue is smaller and less reliable than predicted under risk neutral Nash equilibrium bidding. Lower average revenue might be attributed to risk aversion, while the high variability is attributed to a sizable frequency of individual bidding errors relative to the theory. Bidding theory precisely organizes English auction outcomes after a brief initial learning period. The dominant strategy equilibrium does not organize second-price auctions nearly as well, as market prices persistently exceed predicted prices. The difference between English and second-price outcomes is attributed to effects of different information flows, inherent in the structure of the two institutions, on eliminating bidding errors. Revenue impacts of these two institutions, relative to a first-price auction, are examined in light of observed bidding patterns.","John H. Kagel, Ronald M. Harstad and Dan Levin",John H.

Consistent out-of-equilibrium beliefs, on the other hand, are derived by taking the closure of belief-strategy profile pairs, for totally mixed strategies. Kreps and Wilson (1982) claim that consistent beliefs are structurally consistent; that is, out-of-equilibrium beliefs can be rationalized by some single alternative conjecture as to the strategy opponents have used. We show by example that this is incorrect. Moreover, while equilibrium beliefs are structurally consistent in some cases, the alternative conjectures that justify them are inconsistent with the hypothesis (implicit in sequential rationality) that there will be no further defections from the initially hypothesized equilibrium strategies. These difficulties disappear if one relaxes the requirement of structural consistency, so that out-of-equilibrium conjectures may be formed as convex combinations of conjectures strategies of opponents.

Depending on the equilibrium, the privately informed agent's action could reveal the private information, partially or completely. If the private information is completely revealed, the equilibrium is called separating. A key element in the analysis of separating equilibria is the examination of the implied incentive compatibility constraints (namely, that no type should have an incentive to take an action other than the prescribed equilibrium action). It is shown that these constraints together with one of two conditions imply differentiability of strategies when the set of possible types is an interval. The first condition, implied by sequentiality in many games, is an initial value condition on the informed agent's strategy. The second condition is a monotonicity condition which is similar to the familiar single crossing condition. The monotonicity condition turns out to be necessary and sufficient for there to be a strictly monotonic strategy satisfying the incentive compatibility constraints. As a direct consequence of these two results, the analysis of Milgrom and Roberts (1982) is considerably strengthened.",George J. Mailath,George J. Mailath,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

First, we establish the generic existence of forward induction equilibrium by exploiting the results of Kohlberg and Mertens (1986).

The null hypothesis is that Zurcher's decisions on bus engine replacement coincide with an optimal stopping rule: a strategy which specifies whether or not to replace the current bus engine each period as a function of observed and unobserved state variables. The optimal stopping rule is the solution to a stochastic dynamic programming problem that formalizes the trade-off between the conflicting objectives of minimizing maintenance costs versus minimizing unexpected engine failures. The model depends on unknown ""primitive parameters"" which specify Zurcher's expectations of the future values of the state variables, the expected costs of regular bus maintenance, and his perceptions of the customer goodwill costs of unexpected failures. Using ten years of monthly data on bus mileage and engine replacements for a subsample of 104 buses in the company fleet, I estimate these primitive parameters and test whether Zurcher's behavior is consistent with the model. Admittedly, few people are likely to take particular interest in Harold Zurcher and bus engine replacement per se. I focus on a specific individual and capital good because it provides a simple, concrete framework to illustrate two ideas: (i) a ""bottom-up"" approach for modelling replacement investment, and (ii) a ""nested fixed point"" algorithm for estimating dynamic programming models of discrete choice.",John Rust,John Rust,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We analyze the consequences of this ""stickness"" of the goods's current price through a speed of adjustment parameter that yields instantaneous adjustment as a limiting case. Our analysis is conducted in terms of a differential game. The open-loop and closed-loop Nash equilibrium strategies are derived, from which the corresponding asymptotically stable steady-state equilibrium prices for the good are obtained. These equilibrium prices are then analyzed as the speed of price adjustment becomes instantaneous.

In particular, the methods employed in the measurement of poverty have been the subject of criticism. This paper re-examines three basic issues in measuring poverty: the choice of the poverty line, the index of poverty, and the relation between poverty and inequality. One general theme running through the paper is that there is a diversity of judgments which enter the measurement of poverty and that it is necessary to recognize these explicitly in the procedures adopted. There is likely to be disagreement about the choice of poverty line, affecting both its level and its structure. In this situation, we may only be able to make comparisons and not to measure differences, and the comparisons may lead only to a partial rather than a complete ordering. The first section of the paper discusses the stochastic dominance conditions which allow such comparisons, illustrating their application by reference to data for the United States. The choice of poverty measure has been the subject of an extensive literature and a variety of measures have been proposed. In the second section of the paper a different approach is suggested, considering a class of measures satisfying certain general properties and seeking conditions under which all members of the class (which includes many of those proposed) give the same ranking. Those sceptical about measures of poverty often assert that poverty and inequality are being confounded.

Using a single data set (PSID 1975 labor supply data) we are able to replicate most of the range of estimated income and substitution effects found in previous studies in this field. We undertake extensive specification tests and find that most of this range should be rejected due to statistical and model misspecifications. The two most important assumptions appear to be (i) the Tobit assumption used to control for self-selection into the labor force and (ii) exogeneity assumptions on the wife's wage rate and her labor market experience. The Tobit models exaggerate both the income and wage effects. The exogeneity assumptions induce an upwards bias in the estimated wage effect; the bias due to the exogeneity assumption on the wife's labor market experience, however, substantially diminishes when one controls for self-selection into the labor force through the use of unrestricted generalized Tobit procedures. An examination of the maintained assumptions in previous studies further supports these results. These inferences suggest that the small responses to variations in wage rates and nonwife income found here provide a more accurate description of the behavioral responses of working married women than those found in most previous studies.",Thomas A.

The coefficient estimators can be used to construct test statistics for homoskedasticity and conditional symmetry of the error distribution, and we find these tests compare quite favorably with other commonly-used tests of these null hypotheses in terms of local relative efficiency. Consequently, asymmetric least squares estimation provides a convenient and relatively efficient method of summarizing the conditional distribution of a dependent variable given the regressors, and a means of testing whether a linear model is an adequate characterization of the ""typical value"" for this conditional distribution.",Whitney K.

A slight variation on the instrumental variables theme yields a simple, efficient alternative to FIML. Here we augment the original equation system by additional equations that are implied by the covariance restrictions. We show that when these additional equations are linearized around an initial consistent estimator and three-stage least squares is performed on the original equation system together with the linearized equations implied by the covariance restrictions, an asymptotically efficient estimator is obtained. We also present a relatively simple method of obtaining an initial consistent estimator when the covariance restrictions are needed for identification. This estimator also makes use of additional equations that are implied by the covariance restrictions. In the final section of the paper we consider identification from the point of view of the moment restrictions that are implied by instrument-residual orthogonality and the covariance restrictions.

Under Hotelling's assumptions (uniform distribution of consumers, travel cost proportional to distance, inelastic demand of one unit by each consumer) the price-setting subgames possess equilibria in pure strategies for only a limited set of location pairs. Because of this problem (pointed out independently by Vickrey (1964) and d'Aspremont et al. (1979)), Hotelling's claim that there is an equilibrium of the two-stage game in which the firms locate close to each other is incorrect. A result of Dasgupta and Maskin (1986) guarantees that each price-setting subgame has an equilibrium in mixed strategies. We first study these mixed strategy equilibria. We are unable to provide a complete characterization of them, although we show that for a subset of location pairs all equilibria are of a certain type. We reduce the problem of finding an equilibrium of this type to that of solving three or fewer highly nonlinear equations. At each of a large number of location pairs we have computed approximate solutions to the system of equations. Next, we use our analytical results and computations to study the equilibrium location choices of the firms. There is a unique (up to symmetry) subgame perfect equilibrium in which the location choices of the firms are pure; in it, the firms locate 0.27 from the ends of the market. At this equilibrium, the support of the subgame equilibrium price strategy is the union of two short intervals. Most of the probability weight is in the upper interval, so that this strategy is reminiscent of occasional ""sales"" by the firms. We also find a subgame perfect equilibrium in which each firm uses a mixed strategy in locations. In fact, in the class of strategy pairs in which the firms use the same mixed strategy over locations, and this strategy is symmetric about .5, there is a single equilibrium. In this equilibrium most of the probability weight of the common strategy is between 0.2 and 0.4, and between 0.6 and 0.8. There is a wide range of pure Nash (as opposed to subgame perfect) equilibrium location pairs: the subgame strategies in which each firm threatens to charge a price of zero in response to a deviation support all but those location pairs in which the firms are very close.",Martin J.

An axiom due to Harsanyi, called bilateral stability, is used to obtain the following integrability result: Any solution satisfying Pareto optimality, continuity and bilateral stability can be represented by an additively separable Bergson-Samuelson social welfare function.",Terje Lensberg,Terje Lensberg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The no torsion condition says that, in the relevant range of income, the Engel curve is contained in a plane through the origin (which may depend on the price vector). The uniform curvature condition says that in addition, the Engel curve is either convex or concave to the origin.

The model assumes that families maximize intertemporal utility subject to the constraint that net worth always exceed a portion of consumption expenditure (transactions balances) and a minimal amount of equity in home(s) and automobile(s). Liquidity constraints shorten the family's effective planning horizon, which extends to a time that the family expects to first encounter binding borrowing constraints. Families with short multiperiod planning horizons are liquidity constrained but do not necessarily consume in accordance with their contemporaneous disposable income. The estimated model explains over 60 per cent of the consumption variance of families in the lower 99.1 per cent of the wealth distribution. Wealthier families appear to plan substantial bequests. Liquidity constrained families are estimated to constitute 19.4 per cent of the population sampled, a group that accounts for 16.7 per cent of consumption in the population sampled. More than half of these families have short multiperiod horizons. In-sample simulations of the model suggest that a temporary tax has three to four times more impact on aggregate consumption than it would if liquidity constraints were not in effect.",Randall P.

A distribution-free (or semiparametric) estimator is one that does not require any assumption about the distribution of the stochastic error term in the model, apart from regularity conditions. For the binary choice model, we obtain an explicit lower bound for the asymptotic variance for the slope parameters, or more generally the parameters of a nonlinear regression function in the underlying latent variable model, but we find that there is no regular semiparametric estimator of the constant term (identified by requiring the error distribution to have zero median). Lower bounds are also obtained under the further assumption that the error distribution is symmetric, and in this case there is a finite lower bound for the constant term too. Comparison of the bounds with those for the classical parametric problem shows the loss of information due to lack of a priori knowledge of the functional form of the error distribution. We give the conditions for equality of the parametric and semiparametric lower bounds (in which case adaptive estimation may be possible), both with and without the assumption of a symmetric error distribution. In general, adaptive estimation is not possible, but one special case where these conditions hold is when the regression function is linear and the explanatory variables have a multivariate normal distribution. The Tobit model considered here is the censored nonlinear regression model, with a fixed censoring point. We again give an explicit lower bound for the asymptotic variance for the regression parameters, this time including a constant term (if the error term has zero median). Comparison with the corresponding lower bound for the parametric case shows that adaptive estimation is in general not possible for this model.",Stephen R. Cosslett,Stephen R.

If their types are independently distributed, the buyers prefer the SPA to the FPA-R to the FPA if they exhibit decreasing absolute risk aversion, and they are indifferent between all three auctions if they have constant absolute risk aversion. Their preferences are biased away from the SPA if their types are affiliated: they then prefer the FPA to the SPA if they exhibit constant absolute risk aversion, and the comparison is ambiguous if they exhibit decreasing absolute risk aversion. Affiliation also biases the buyer's preferences toward, and the seller's preferences away from, the revealing policy: assuming constant or decreasing or no risk aversion, the buyers prefer the FPA-R to the FPA, and the expected price is greater in the FPA than the FPA-R.",Steven Matthews,Steven Matthews,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

In the first part, we adopt the framework of the theory of expected utility with rank-dependent probabilities to show that the well known ""preference reversal"" phenomenon can be consistent with transitive preferences. When this phenomenon is consistent with transitive preferences, it violates the von Neumann-Morgenstern independence axiom. Consequently, the ""preference reversal"" phenomenon may be explicated by other nonexpected utility theories. The experiments that produced the evidence on ""preference reversal"" attempted to elicit the certainty equivalents of given lotteries. The second part of this paper shows that the experimental design used in many of these experiments will elicit the certainty equivalents of given lotteries if and only if the respondent's preferences can be represented by expected utility functionals.

If each element of a vector of time series x<sub>t</sub> first achieves stationarity after differencing, but a linear combination <tex-math>$\alpha ^{\prime }x_{t}$</tex-math> is already stationary, the time series x<sub>t</sub> are said to be co-integrated with co-integrating vector α. There may be several such co-integrating vectors so that α becomes a matrix. Interpreting <tex-math>$\alpha ^{\prime }x_{t}=0$</tex-math> as a long run equilibrium, co-integration implies that deviations from equilibrium are stationary, with finite variance, even though the series themselves are nonstationary and have infinite variance. The paper presents a representation theorem based on Granger (1983), which connects the moving average, autoregressive, and error correction representations for co-integrated systems. A vector autoregression in differenced variables is incompatible with these representations. Estimation of these models is discussed and a simple but asymptotically efficient two-step estimator is proposed. Testing for co-integration combines the problems of unit root tests and tests with parameters unidentified under the null. Seven statistics are formulated and analyzed. The critical values of these statistics are calculated based on a Monte Carlo simulation. Using these critical values, the power properties of the tests are examined and one test procedure is recommended for application. In a series of examples it is found that consumption and income are co-integrated, wages and prices are not, short and long interest rates are, and nominal GNP is co-integrated with M2, but not M1, M3, or aggregate liquid assets.",Robert F.

The optimal compensation scheme is found to be a linear function of a vector of N accounts which count the number of times that each of the N kinds of observable events occurs. The number N is independent of the number of time periods, so the accounts may entail substantial aggregation. In a continuous time version of the problem, the agent controls the drift rate of a vector of accounts that is subject to frequent, small random fluctuations. The solution is as if the problem were the static one in which the agent controls only the mean of a multivariate normal distribution and the principal is constrained to use a linear compensation rule. If the principal can observe only coarser linear aggregates, such as revenues, costs, or profits, the optimal compensation scheme is then a linear function of those aggregates. The combination of exponential utility, normal distributions, and linear compensation schemes makes computations and comparative statics easy to do, as we illustrate. We interpret our linearity results as deriving in part from the richness of the agent's strategy space, which makes it possible for the agent to undermine and exploit complicated, nonlinear functions of the accounting aggregates.",Bengt Holmstrom and Paul Milgrom,Bengt Holmstrom,Paul Milgrom,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

In particular, although the more eager types of buyer do pay higher prices and yield the monopoly higher profit, they may receive lower quality or lower warranty overage.

The so-called ""game-theoretic"" viewpoint holds that probabilities can only be assigned to events not governed by rational decision makers; for the latter, one must substitute an equilibrium (or other game-theoretic) notion. The current formulation synthesizes the two viewpoints: Correlated equilibrium is viewed as the result of Bayesian rationality; the equilibrium condition appears as a simple maximization of utility on the part of each player, given his information. A feature of this approach is that it does not require explicit randomization on the part of the players.

In this paper we study the set of Bayesian implementable decision rules which have the further property that the information conveyed in the process of their implementation does not invalidate the optimality of the players' strategies. We call such rules posterior implementable. We concentrate on a two-person problem with two possible decisions, and, for this problem, we obtain a complete characterization of the set of posterior implementable decision rules. Our main result entails that a posterior implementable social decision rule can take essentially only two values throughout the range of observations of the two players. The domains over which each of these two outcomes is realized can be characterized by the fact that the boundary between them is a step function satisfying a certain set of equations. The motivation for studying posterior implementable rules is that they represent the outcomes of a two-stage cooperative process. In the first stage, communication takes place but no binding commitments can be made. The second stage consists of ratifying (""signing"") the agreement obtained at the first stage. At this state, no further information is conveyed. Both parties must be satisfied with the nonbinding commitments obtained at the first stage, so that these actions are actually carried out.

The conditions involve smoothness of agents' utility functions and certain nice properties of the aggregate endowments process and the dividend processes of traded assets. In place of the dynamic programming, a martingale representation technique is utilized to characterize equilibrium portfolio policies. This technique is useful even when there does not exist a finite dimensional Markov structure in the economy and thus the Markovian stochastic dynamic programming is not applicable. Agents are shown to hold certain hedging mutual funds and the riskless asset. In contrast to earlier results, the market portfolio does not have a role in hedging. When there exists a finite dimensional Markov system in the economy, the dimension of the hedging demand identified through the Markovian dynamic programming may be much larger than that identified by the martingale method.",Chi-Fu Huang,Chi-Fu Huang,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We prove properness for all mixtures of risk-averse exponential functions and hence (by complete monotonicity) of all risk-averse power and logarithmic functions.

Thus some traders will be using less than the maximum budget available to them, creating a total budget excess. This suggests a revision of the equilibrium concept that allows the budget excess to be divided among all the traders, as dividends. Each trader's budget is then the sum of his dividend and the market value of his endowment. A given system of dividends and prices defines a dividend equilibrium if it generates equal supply and demand. This in itself is not satisfactory because it is too broad: Every Pareto optimal allocation is sustained by some system of dividends and prices. However, the Shapely value yields much more specific information. We prove that, when there are many individually insignificant agents, every Shapely value allocation is generated by a system of dividends and prices in which all dividends are nonnegative and depend only on the net trade sets of the agents, not on their utilities. Moreover, the dependence is monotonic; the larger the net trade set, the higher the dividend. The same result holds for markets with fixed prices, which can be analyzed formally as a special case of markets with satiation. On a more technical level, our analysis has some unusual features. We use a finite-type asymptotic model, rather than a nonatomic continuum. Surprisingly, the results are qualitatively different. (The continuum is too rough a tool for our problem, and leads to inconclusive results.) Also, small coalitions play a critical role in our analysis. (We are led to equations in which the first-order terms cancel; the second-order terms, which take events of small probability into account, become decisive.)",Robert J. Aumann and Jacques H.

The adjustment procedure suggests that because measurement errors give rise to spurious transitions between labor market states, the labor market may be less dynamic than previously thought.

Under formula apportionment, a firm's tax payments to a given state depend on its total profits nationally (or internationally) times an average of the fractions of the firm's total property, payroll, and sales located in that state. This apportionment of a firm's total profits among states, based on three separate factors, in effect creates three separate taxes, each with complicated incentive effects. A large part of our analysis is concerned with the component of the tax tied to the allocation of property. Under this tax, price distortions differ in general among firms within the same state, creating incentives for firms producing in different states to merge their operations. State tax policies are also affected by this apportionment formula: states choose inefficiently low tax rates and are encouraged to shift to direct taxation of property. The component of the tax based on payroll creates many similar incentives. With this tax, however, the marger of firms producing different goods is discouraged.When a sales component to the tax is added, there are incentives for the cross-hauling of output, with production in low tax rates states sold in high tax rate states, and conversely. None of the above distortions are created when the corporate tax uses separate accounting to divide a firm's profits among states. The final section presents an alternative apportionment formula which retains the administrative advantages of existing law, yet creates the same incentives as separate accounting as long as there are no economic profits.",Roger Gordon and John D.

Two other solution concepts for multistage games are proposed here: the extensive form correlated equilibrium, where the players can observe private extraneous signals at every stage and the communication equilibrium where the players are furthermore allowed to transmit inputs to an appropriate device at every stage. We show that the set of payoffs associated with each solution concept has a canonical representation (in the spirit of the revelation principle) and is a convex polyhedron.

In particular, the notion of hierarchy provides a useful tool when one wants to draw inferences on the structural change or international difference of industrial structures. The standard technique for studying this notion is to triangularize the input-output table by interchanging sectors in order to maximize the entries below the main diagonal. In a perfect triangularized table, the entries above the main diagonal should be zero. For example, such a strong one-way interdependence relation as cotton-textiles-clothing can easily establish the hierarchy. Due to the existence of circular relations like coal-steel-mining equipment-coal, it is not possible to triangularize the input-output table perfectly. This paper extends and revises the previous triangulation method which is based on a permutation theorem deriving from the interchange of adjoining two industrial groups, into that among vhree industrial groups (Theorem 2). The new algorithm based on Theorem 2 is demonstrated by actually computing the suboptimal orderings for the four input-output tables for such more developed countries (MDC's) as the United States, Italy, Norway, Japan, and the two tables for such less developed countries (LDC's) as India and Korea. The empirical results suggest that sectors can be arranged in a similar hierarchical order among MDC's and LDC's. Transport Equipment, Machinery, Apparel, Leather and Products, Grain Mill Products, and Processed Foods, which link directly to the final demand, are recorded as higher-order sectors. Trade, Transport, and services are lower-order ones, and Energy sectors such as Electric Power, Coal Products, Coal Mining, Petroleum, Petroleum Products and Natural Gas are the lowest. Consequently, this paper provides some more evidence in support of the similarity of hierarchical structures of production among these countries.",Yukio Fukui,Yukio Fukui,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

In conventional arbitration the arbitration award is argued to be a function of both the offers of the parties and the appropriate award. The weight that the arbitrator puts on the appropriate award relative to the offers is hypothesized to be a function of the quality of the offers as measured by the difference between the offers. In final-offer arbitration it is argued that the arbitrator chooses the offer that is closest to the appropriate award. The model is implemented empirically using data gathered from practicing arbitrators regarding their decisions in twenty-five hypothetical cases. The estimates of the general model strongly support the characterizations of arbitrator behavior in the two schemes.

In order to overcome the institutional criticisms of the formal bargaining literature, the paper generalizes the Nash-Zeuthen-Harsanyi model by linking the solution to the institutional concepts of bargaining power and fear or cost of disagreement and by making the outcome depend not only on endogenous but also on exogenous factors. An operational specification of bargaining power and fear of disagreement allows the model to be estimated with data covering twelve companies and trade unions during the period from mid-1950's to the late 1970's. While giving limited support to the Nash-Zeuthen-Harsanyi solution, the empirical analysis indicates that the bargaining outcome usually deviates from the Nash-Zeuthen-Harsanyi point and, in accordance with the institutionalist claim, that it varies significantly with exogenous factors. Contrary to the traditional labor economics view, the results do not support the general conclusion that the bargaining solution lies on the marginal revenue product curve of labor. Instead, the relevant coefficients suggest that for many firms and unions the outcome might be better characterized by the efficient contract (vertical contract curve).",Jan Svejnar,Jan Svejnar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

With privately known heterogeneous mortality probabilities, adverse selection causes the rate of return on private annuities to be less than the actuarially fair rate based on population average mortality. However, a fully funded social security system with compulsory participation can offer an implied rate of return equal to the actuarially fair rate based on population average mortality. Thus, since social security offers a higher rate of return than private annuities, consumers cannot completely offset the effects of social security by transacting in the private annuity market. Using an overlapping generations model with uncertain lifetimes, we demonstrate that the introduction of actuarially fair social security reduces the steady state rate of return on annuities. In addition, it raises the steady state levels of average bequests and average consumption of the young, if factor prices are fixed exogenously. The steady state national capital stock rises or falls according to the strength of the bequest motive.",Andrew B. Abel,Andrew B. Abel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The monetary policymaker maximizes his own (politically motivated) objective function that is positively related to economic stimulation through monetary suprises and negatively related to monetary growth. The relative importance he assigns to each target shifts stochastically through time. His current preference trade-off is known to him but not to the public. When choosing the (state contingent) path of money growth for the present and the future, the policy aker compares the benefits from current stimulation with the costs associated with higher future inflation expectations. Current monetary growth conveys information to the public about future money growth because there is persistence in the policymaker's objectives. Although expectations are rational, information is imperfect because monetary control procedures are imprecise. As a result the public cannot correctly distinguish persistent changes of emphasis on different policy objectives from transitory monetary control errors. The public becomes aware of changes gradually by observing past monetary growth. Credibility is defined in terms of the speed with which the public recognizes changes in the objectives of the policymaker. Credibility is lower the noisier monetary control and the more stable the objectives of the policymaker. Looser monetary control and a higher degree of time preference on the part of the policymaker induce him to produce higher and more variable monetary growth. When the policymaker is free to determine the accuracy of monetary control he does not always choose the most effective control available in spite of the fact that monetary surprises always have an expected value of zero. The reason is that ambiguous control procedures enable the policymaker to generate positive surprises when he cares more than on average about economic stimulation. He leaves the inevitable negative surprises for periods in which he cares more about inflation prevention. This result provides an explanation for the Fed's preference for ambiguity, recently documented by Goodfriend (1986). The policymaker is more likely to pick more ambiguous control procedures the more uncertain his objectives and the higher his time preference. The paper also provides a theoretical underpinning for the well documented cross-country positive correlation between the level and the variability of inflation.",Alex Cukierman and Allan H.

For each set of probability assessments there exists a corresponding equilibrium, one with the original agents, original equilibrium allocations, and no expected financial gains from trade under the given probability assessments.

This paper presents and then estimates a model which uses observations on the proportion of different cohorts of patents which are renewed at alternative ages, and the relevant renewal fee schedules, to estimate the distribution of the returns earned from holding patents, and the evolution of this distribution function over the lifespan of the patents. Since patents are often applied for at an early exploratory stage of the innovation process, the model allows patentees to be uncertain about the sequence of returns that will be earned if the patent is kept in force. The paper solves the implied optimal stopping problem for the micro units, derives the implications of these solutions on the aggregate proportion renewed, and then estimates the parameters of the model from the aggregate data. Separate estimates are obtained from data on post World War II cohorts of patents in each of France the United Kingdom, and Germany.",Ariel Pakes,Ariel Pakes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

This appropriate award is defined as a function of the facts of the case independently of the offers of the parties. In conventional arbitration the arbitration award is argued to be a function of both the offers of the parties and the appropriate award. The weight that the arbitrator puts on the appropriate award relative to the offers is hypothesized to be a function of the quality of the offers as measured by the difference between the offers. In final-offer arbitration it is argued that the arbitrator chooses the offer that is closest to the appropriate award. The model is implemented empirically using data gathered from practicing arbitrators regarding their decisions in twenty-five hypothetical cases. The estimates of the general model strongly support the characterizations of arbitrator behavior in the two schemes. In addition, no substantial differences were found in the determination of the appropriate award implicit in conventional arbitration decisions and the determination of the appropriate award implicit in the final-offer decisions.",Henry S.

Since short-run monetary policy is set for seasonally adjusted data when only preliminary estimates for recent months are available, an interesting question is: Would policy have been much different if final data had been available? For the period of the seventies, we estimate what would have been the monthly Federal Open Market Committee targets for M1 and the federal funds rate if the preliminary estimate of the rate of growth of seasonally adjusted M1 had been equal to the final one. We find that, despite their large size, revision errors seem to have little impact on the setting of targets. The results suggest that the Fed reacts to a signal in the rate of growth of M1 which is smoother than the seasonally adjusted series and less affected by revisions. Since the error associated with the revision is orthogonal to the preliminary measurement, while the noise extracted is orthogonal to the ""true"" variable (the signal), the analysis illustrates the different effects of the two alternative error-in-variable specifications.",Agustín Maravall and David A.

In the context of Wicksell's model of durable goods, Peter Swan has shown that such ""planned obsolescence"" is never optimal: a monopolist seller of durable goods maximizes profits by setting product durability equal to the competitive or socially optimal level, and efficiently extracts consumer surplus through sales price alone. This paper formulates a monopolist seller's choice of price and durability as the solution to a Stackelberg game between the monopolist and consumers. We employ a new equilibrium model of a durable goods market which, unlike Wicksell's model, recognizes that scrappage of durables is endogenously determined. We show that with endogenous scrappage, consumers have a substitution possibility which constrains the profits of a monopolist seller. This constraint on profits causes the monopolist to distort durability from the socially optimal level. We derive conditions under which this distortion takes its most extreme form: the monopolist kills off competition from used durables by producing new assets of zero durability.",John Rust,John Rust,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We demonstrate that if the probability that agents are linked with each other does not tend to zero too fast as this number increases, then the probability that a coalition will form and block any non-Walrasian allocation tends to one, as the number of agents goes to infinity.","A.

The insider makes positive profits by exploiting his monopoly power optimally in a dynamic context, where noise trading provides camouflage which conceals his trading from market makers.

We extend the procedure to the nonhomothetic 3-good case, and we apply the extended procedure to the translog, generalized Leontief, and minflex Laurent flexible functional form. In addition, we acquire the regular regions for the minflex Laurent model in the 2-good nonhomothetic case and superimpose the resulting regions on those already found by Caves and Christensen for the translog and generalized Leontief models. We find that the new minflex Laurent model generally has the largest regular regions of the three flexible functional forms. In addition, the regular region of the minflex Laurent model is found to expand as real income increases. As a result, that model is particularly well suited for use with time series data, which typically is characterized by positive long term growth trends in real income. In such applications, all recent data and future forecasts can be expected to lie within the regular region of the minflex Laurent model. Although it is possible for some of the earliest data to fall outside that regular region, the model's regular region nevertheless is sufficiently large to hold even all of those earliest data points in many data sets. The regular region of each of three models moves when the model's parameters are changed. With the generalized Leontief or translog model, the regular region's shape, location, and size are unpredictable without prior knowledge of the model's parameters. With either of those two models, the intersection of the model's regular regions, as the parameters are changed, is contained within a very small neighborhood of the one point at which we require the model to be regular. With the minflex Laurent model, the primary properties of the regular regions are invariant to the values of the parameters, and the intersection of the displayed regular regions is a very large unbounded set.

These cycles are not attributable to exogenous ""shocks"" nor to any variation of policy since there are none in the model. Markets clear in the Walrasian sense at every date, and traders have perfect foresight along the cycles. The origin of these cycles is the potential conflict between the wealth effect and the intertemporal substitution effect that are associated with real interest rate movements. Business cycles appear in particular when the degree of concavity of a trader's utility function is sufficiently higher for old agents than for younger ones. The techniques employed to study the occurrence and the stability of such business cycles are borrowed partly from recent mathematical theories that have been constructed by using the notion of the ""bifurcation"" of a dynamical system in order to explain the emergence of cycles and the transition to turbulent (""chaotic"") behavior in physical, biological, or ecological systems. The equilibrium level of output is shown to be negatively related to the equilibrium level of the real interest rate. A similar relation exists (but in the opposite direction) between equilibrium real money balances and real interest rates. These relations hold both in the long run, i.e. along business cycles, and in the short run, i.e. on the transition path, and whether movements of the real interest rate are anticipated or not. The basic ingredient there is the condition that older agents have a higher marginal propensity to consume leisure. Monetary policy by means of nominal interests payments is shown to be extremely effective. A permanent change of the rate of growth of the money supply by these means is superneutral. Yet, there exists a very simple deterministic countercyclical policy that enables monetary authorities to stabilize completely business cycles and to force the economy back to the unique (Golden rule) stationary state. Due to the nonlinearity of the model such a policy affects not only the variances of real equilibrium magnitudes but also their means.",Jean-Michel Grandmont,Jean-Michel Grandmont,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Any such cost accounting method can create incentives among product managers within the firm for altering the production function to their advantage. It is therefore both reasonable and desirable that a method reward increased efficientl by attributing lower unit costs to products whose marginal cost of production uniformly decreases. It is shown that there is only one ""symmetric"" method that satisfies this ""monotonicity"" principle--namely, the Aumann-Shapley price mechanism based on the Aumann-Shapley value for nonatomic games.

If, however, agents observe their private information before contracting, there may be further restrictions, due to information leakage during the process of bargaining over mechanisms, on what they can achieve by contract. These restrictions are characterized and compared to those proposed for this setting by Holmstrom and Myerson [6].

Several economists criticized this policy on the ground that not taxing UI benefits while taxing earned income allegedly encourages unemployed persons to conduct longer than socially optimal job searches. Since 1979, however, UI benefits received by persons in higher-income families have been subject to income tax. This paper investigates whether the introduction of benefit taxation has had the predicted effect of reducing unemployment duration. The study uses data on a sample of persons that filed for UI in 1978 or 1979 to examine whether high-income claimants collected benefits for shorter periods after the tax change than they did before benefits became taxable. As part of the empirical analysis, the paper develops a generalization of the Weibull distribution and applies a limited-dependent-variable technique for this distribution similar to the Tobit technique for the normal distribution. Despite some variation in the results from different model specifications, the analysis presents persuasive evidence of a tax effect on unemployment duration.

It is shown that in the presence of other weak axioms the egalitarian solutions are the only monotonic ones.

In this paper we present estimates of a demand system that takes explicit account of this hypothesis. We show how the restrictions from demand theory enable us to identify the model despite the presence of an unobservable variable that can be interpreted as revisions to the marginal utility of discounted expenditure. This allows us to take explicit account of the different effects of anticipated and unanticipated price changes. An important check on our model is the derivation of expenditure elasticities despite the fact that the demand system does not have expenditure on the right hand side. Our estimates are ""sensible"" and we find that we can reject the hypothesis that revisions to the marginal utility of discounted money are orthogonal to the past values of our variables.

The probabilities of revolution depend on the strategies which the two revolutionary entrepreneurs propose. There is an equilibrium pair of strategies; the task is to study with properties it has. In particular, it is shown that various ""tyrannical"" aspects of the Tsar's strategy, and ""progressive"" aspects of Lenin's strategy need not flow from ideological precommitments, but are simply good optimizing behavior, given their respective goals in this game.

The decision to substitute then is an investment decision. Such substitution costs, in conjunction with problems of oppportunism, have frequently been seen as a reason for vertical integration. Reputation for a fair treatment of customers may enable suppliers to maintain market relations for goods involving substitution costs. A model looks at ""competitive distance"" between two goods with substitution costs. If future tastes are uncertain the model shows that with low rates of discount or high rates of market growth competitive distance declines as substitution costs rise. It is also shown that competitive distance rises with a rising rate of discount. Given the effectiveness of the reputation mechanism, numerical analysis shows that competitive distance is smaller in most cases with substitution costs than without substitution costs.",C.

By far the model specification which is used most often is the multinomial logit model. Yet it is widely known that a potentially important drawback of the multinomial logit model is the independence from irrelevant alternatives property. While most analysts recognize the implications of the independence of irrelevant alternatives property, it has remained basically a maintained assumption in applications. In the paper we provide two sets of computationally convenient specification tests for the multinomial logit model. The first test is an application of the Hausman [10] specification test procedure. The basic idea for the test here is to test the reverse implication of the independence from irrelevant alternatives property. The test statistic is easy to compute since it only requires computation of a quadratic form which involves the difference of the parameter estimates and the differences of the estimated covariance matrices. The second set of specification tests that we propose is based on more classical test procedures. We consider a generalization of the multinomial logit model which is called the nested logit model. Since the multinomial logit model is a special case of the more general model when a given parameter equals one, classical test procedures such as the Wald, likelihood ratio, and Lagrange multiplier tests can be used. The two sets of specification test procedures care then compared for an example where exact and approximate comparisons are possible.",Jerry Hausman and Daniel McFadden,Jerry Hausman,Daniel McFadden,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

We will show that the criterion obtained here reflects a tradeoff between parsimony (i.e. parameter space dimensionality) and data fit, has desirable invariance properties, and applies to nested and nonnested model comparisons. Furthermore, in nested model comparisons, this criterion can be interpreted in terms of an adjusted likelihood ratio test in which for large data samples the significance level is a declining function of the sample size.

Since a variety of other economic data come in the form of repeated counts of some individual actions or events, the methodology should have wide applications. The statistical models we develop are applications and generalizations of Poisson distribution. Two important issues are (i) Given the panel nature of our data, how can we allow for separate persistent individual (fixed or random) effects? (ii) How does one introduce the equivalent of disturbances-in-the-equation into the analysis of Poisson and other discrete probability functions? The first problem is solved by conditioning on the total sum of outcomes over the observed years, while the second problem is solved by introducing an additional source of randomness, allowing the Poisson parameter to be itself randomly distributed, and compounding the two distributions. Lastly, we develop a test statistic for the presence of serial correlation when fixed effects estimators are used in nonlinear conditional models.","Jerry Hausman, Bronwyn H.

Three slightly different versions of a well-known small open economy macroeconomic model are used to illustrate three fairly general ways of specifying the required boundary conditions.

The second represents the case when the number of stable roots exceeds the number of predetermined variables but a sufficient number of linear restrictions on the state variables at an initial date is given to guarantee a unique solution.

This procedure modifies the usual Monte Carlo approach to stochastic simulations of the model in that calculated residuals over the sample period are used as proxies for disturbances instead of random draws from some assumed parametric distribution. In comparison with the Monte Carlo predictor, the residual-based should be less sensitive to distributional assumptions concerning disturbances in the system. It is also less demanding computationally. The large-sample asymptotic moments of the residual-based predictor are derived in this paper and compared with those of the Monte Carlo predictor. Both procedures are asymptotically unbiased. In terms of asymptotic mean squared prediction error (AMSPE), the Monte Carlo is efficient relative to the residual-based when the number of replications in the Monte Carlo simulations is large relative to sample size. This order of relative efficiency is reversed, however, when replication and sample sizes are similar. In any event, the amount by which the AMSPE of either predictor exceeds the low bound for AMSPE is small as a percentage of the lower bound AMSPE when sample and replication sizes are at least of moderate magnitude.

We discuss and derive a unified model of the demand for consumer durables and the derived demand for electricity. To determine the magnitude of the bias resulting from estimating a unit electricity consumption (UEC) equation by ordinary least squares when unobserved factors influence both choice of appliances and intensity of use, we introduce and estimate a joint water-heat space-heat choice model, and conclude with the consistent estimation and specification of demand for electricity equations.",Jeffrey A.

It is shown that if the union has any power, investment is lower in the absence of binding contracts. The associated input levels and shareholders' profits are identical to those that emerge if contracts are binding and the firm acts as if it faces a cost of capital which is a linear combination of the purchase price of capital and the resale value. This implicit cost is greater than the purchase price, is an increasing function of union power, and is independent of the profit function and the alternative wage. Increases in union power reduce shareholders' profits but may increase wages at some points and decrease wages at others. In the absence of binding contracts, shareholders' profits are lower but there is a critical level of union power (depending on the profit function) such that the union is worse off if its power is higher than this level and better off if it is lower.",Paul A.

The structure analyzed is sufficiently rich to admit the basic structures of many of the common models of commodity differentiation as special cases. Thus, the model provides a unifying framework within which alternative formulations of strategic product choice can be compared. It is shown that competitive equilibria exist under only mild restrictions on the underlying economic structure and vary continuously with endowments. Finally, some results relevant to all models of commodity differentiation featuring price taking consumers are presented. The results are shown to point to some potentially important methodological restrictions.",Larry E. Jones,Larry E. Jones,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Allowing for lotteries, contracts with random components, we first establish that an adverse-selection insurance economy, a moral-hazard insurance economy, a signaling economy, and a private-information labor market economy are all special cases of a simple, general structure. We then show that techniques for characterizing Pareto optimal contracts as solutions to concave programming problems are useful and nice and appear to be broadly applicable; allowing for lotteries, we show how to characterize the optimal allocations for the adverse-selection insurance and labor market economies. We then show that standard existence and optimality theorems for competitive equilibria apply in the linear space containing lotteries if agents with characteristics which are distinct and privately observed at the time of initial trading enter the economy-wide resource constraints in a homogeneous way (other kinds of diversity are not critical). For economies with moral hazard which satisfy the homogeneity condition, competitive contract markets single out a subset of the optima and thus can be consistent with apparent unemployment and with a random allocation of labor supplied though all households are averse to risk. The adverse-selection insurance and signaling economies, however, do not satisfy the homogeneity condition and are difficult to decentralize efficiently with a price system.",Edward C.

As the work of White [30], Guilkey, Lovell, and Sickles [19], and others has shown, ordinary flexible functional forms such as the translog cannot achieve this objective. We find that if one is prepared to assume that elasticities of substitution cannot oscillate wildly over the region of interest then consistent estimation is possible using the Fourier flexible form provided the number of fitted parameters increases as the number of observations increases. This result obtains with any of the commonly used statistical methods as, for example, multivariate least squares, maximum likelihood, and three-stage least squares. It obtains if the number of fitted parameters is chosen adaptively by observing the data or chosen deterministically according to some fixed rule. We approach the problem along the classical lines of estimability considerations as used in the study of less than full rank linear statistical models and thereby discover that the problem has a fascinating structure which we explore in detail.","Ibrahim Elbadawi, A.

Important differences are obtained between the results for French firms and for German firms. For both groups, however, firms' expectations or plans are found to be much more concentrated in the no change category than are the realizations they forecast. Consistent biases in the other categories are found for the German, but not the French firms; for the former the conditional distributions of realizations, given prior expectations or plans, are stable over time, while they are unstable for the latter. Of the simple models dealing with the formation of price and demand expectations, the error-learning model (a form of adaptive expectations) gives the best and most parsimonious explanation of the data. Estimation of a joint error-learning model for price anticipations and production plans suggests that the two processes are nearly independent of one another for both groups. A conditional probability model relating production plans to expectations of future demand, inventory level, or order backlog appraisals and recent changes in demand, explains the data about as well as a mechanical error-learning model, but offers scope for improvement and more economic content. Deviations between prior expectations of demand and realizations in the current period are found to affect the deviations between price expectations and production plans from their respective realizations, except for French firms' price expectations.

Ross [12, 14] showed that if there is a factor structure, then the mean returns are approximately linear functions of factor loadings. We define an approximate factor structure and show that this weaker restriction is sufficient for Ross' result. If the covariance matrix of the asset returns has only K unbounded eigenvalues, then there is an approximate factor structure and it is unique.

Our factor structure restrictions build on the following intuitive distinctions between factor variance and idiosyncratic variance: (i) A well-diversified portfolio contains only factor variance. (ii) If a portfolio is uncorrelated with the well-diversified portfolios, then it contains only idiosyncratic variance; so if a sequence of such portfolios becomes well-diversified, the limiting variance should be zero. Our factor structure restrictions imply Ross' [5] arbitrage pricing formula. We obtain upper and lower bounds on the approximation error in that formula; these bounds may be useful in empirical work. They imply that arbitrage pricing is exact if and only if there is a risky, well-diversified portfolio on the mean-variance frontier. If all mean-variance efficient portfolios are well-diversified, then the well-diversified portfolios provide mutual fund separation.

Consumers hold money for self-insurance against random fluctuations. Money may earn interest. Equilibria exist if the rate of interest is sufficiently small. Equilibria may not exist if the rate of interest is too close to some consumer's rate of pure time preference. It follows that Pareto optimality may not be guaranteed by paying interest on money.,Truman Bewley,Truman Bewley,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The approach centers on the constructive technique of approximating distributions developed recently by the author in [10]. This technique utilizes extended rational approximants (ERA's) which build on the strengths of alternative, less flexible approximation methods (such as those based on asymptotic expansions) and which simultaneously blend information from diverse analytic, numerical and experimental sources. The first part of the article explores the general theory of approximation of continuous probability distributions by means of ERA's. Existence, characterization, error bound, and uniqueness theorems for these approximants are given and a new proof is provided for the convergence result obtained earlier in [10]. Some further aspects of finding ERA's by modifications to multiple-point Pade approximants are presented and the new approach is applied to the noncircular serial correlation coefficient. The results of this application demonstrate how ERA's provide systematic improvements over Edgeworth and saddlepoint techniques. These results, taken with those of the earlier article [10], suggest that the approach offers considerable potential for empirical application in terms of its reliability, convenience, and generality.",P.

For the limited information case, covariance restrictions aid identification if and only if they imply that a set of endogenous variables is predetermined in the equation of interest (generalizing the idea of recursiveness). Under full information, covariance restrictions imply that residuals from other equations are predetermined in a particular equation and, under certain conditions, can aid in identification. Sufficient conditions for identification are obtained for the hierarchical system in which the identification of a particular equation does not depend upon the identifiability of higher-numbered equations. In the general case, the FIML first order conditions show that if the system of equations is identifiable as a whole, covariance restrictions cause residuals to behave as instruments. In both limited and full information settings, the link between identification and estimation is worked out: restrictions useful for identification yield instruments required for estimation.",Jerry A.

Existence conditions and consistency conditions with first and higher degree stochastic dominance are derived and an extension of a well known inequality among quasilinear means, which is related to Pratt's [31] condition for comparative risk aversion, is obtained.

Here V(z, θ) is a given function of the exogenous variables z and unknown parameters θ, representing the systematic component of the utility difference, and F is the distribution function of the random component of the utility difference. This paper describes a method of estimating the parameters θ without assuming any functional form for the distribution function F, and proves that this estimator is consistent. F is also consistently estimated. The method uses maximum likelihood estimation in which the likelihood is maximized not only over the parameter θ but also over a space which contains all distribution functions.",Stephen R.

Standard theory of instrumental variables estimation then applies. Furthermore, it turns out that for transformations of the class proposed, asymptotic distribution theory is the same whether the serial correlation properties of the errors are known a priori or estimated. As the number of lagged values of the predetermined variables used as instruments increases, the asymptotic variance of the standard instrumental variables estimator applied to the transformed model approaches that of the optimal estimator proposed by Hansen and Sargent [8].",Fumio Hayashi and Christopher Sims,Fumio Hayashi,Christopher Sims,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Then the TSLS estimator, which is computationally simpler, has appeared a proper choice to empirical researchers. In this article asymptotic properties of the k-class and related estimators are sorted out according to the ratio between the total number of exogenous variables and the number of observations. It is found that the TSLS distribution deviates far from its traditional asymptotic distribution; the LIML distribution stays stable about its traditional asymptotic distribution. The LIML estimator now seems more attractive than the TSLS estimator except for the fact that its exact moments do not exist. A modified estimator is proposed which is asymptotically better than the LIML estimator and whose exact moments exist.",Kimio Morimune,Kimio Morimune,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The monopolist sells his products using an auction mechanism and the market is analyzed as a game with incomplete information in which the buyers as well as the seller are strategic agents. With a small number of buyers, a profit maximizing seller will bundle all his output. This makes buyers uniformly worse off compared to the case where the same monopolist does not bundle, in the sense that any buyer is worse off regardless of his demand for the monopolist's outputs. With a larger number of buyers, the seller will have a tendency to unbundle his output and ""high-demand"" buyers are worse off than they would be if the monopolist bundled his output. ""Low-demand"" buyers, on the other hand, are always better off when the monopolist unbundles his output, regardless of the number of competing buyers. Despite the fact that ""high demand"" buyers are the typical purchasers of the monopolist's output, the net effect of increasing the number of buyers is greater market efficiency since bundling creates market inefficiencies both ex post and ex ante.",Thomas R.

For nonhomogeneous systems algorithms are given for constructing all possible qualitatively determinate systems of a given size.

We show under further assumptions that before S observes his private information, the equilibrium whose partition has the greatest number of elements is Pareto-superior to all other equilibria, and that if agents coordinate on this equilibrium, R's equilibrium expected utility rises when agents' preferences become more similar.

The analysis emphasizes that the interation of inflation and existing tax rules has contributed substantially to the decline of business investment since the late 1960s. Because the investment process is far too complex for any simple econometric model to be convincing, I have estimated three quite different models of investment behavior. The strength of the empirical evidence rests on the fact that all three specifications support the same conclusion. More generally, the analysis and evidence show that the theoretical models of macroeconomic equilibrium should specify explicitly the role of distortionary taxes, especially taxes on capital income.

To generalize this implausible assumption, a new class of stochastic processes called autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (ARCH) processes are introduced in this paper. These are mean zero, serially uncorrelated processes with nonconstant variances conditional on the past, but constant unconditional variances. For such processes, the recent past gives information about the one-period forecast variance. A regression model is then introduced with disturbances following an ARCH process. Maximum likelihood estimators are described and a simple scoring iteration formulated. Ordinary least squares maintains its optimality properties in this set-up, but maximum likelihood is more efficient. The relative efficiency is calculated and can be infinite. To test whether the disturbances follow an ARCH process, the Lagrange multiplier procedure is employed. The test is based simply on the autocorrelation of the squared OLS residuals. This model is used to estimate the means and variances of inflation in the U.K. The ARCH effect is found to be significant and the estimated variances increase substantially during the chaotic seventies.",Robert F.

It represents the result of a variety of separate transactions in small groups without the (centralized) coordination provided by a single Walrasian auctioneer. Necessary conditions and sufficient conditions on allocations for t-wise optimality to imply Pareto optimality are developed.

Because bargaining impasses are generally Pareto-inefficient, anything involving a positive probability of impasse is Pareto-inefficient as well. It is demonstrated that in spite of this avoidable inefficiency, when successful commitment is uncertain and irreversible it can still be rational for individuals to attempt commitment and thereby risk an impasse; in a leading special case, the model reduces to a Prisoner's Dilemma game, in which only strategic-dominance arguments are needed to establish this conclusion. Further, making commitment more difficult, or changing the costs of disagreement in a way that makes available a wider range of settlements that are better for both bargainers than disagreement, need not always lower the probability of impasse, in spite of the conventional wisdom to the contrary.",Vincent P.

Intuitively, for bargaining games in which potential agreements involve lotteries which have a positive probability of leaving one of the players worse off than if a disagreement had occurred, the more risk averse a player, the better the terms of the agreement which had occurred, the more risk averse a player, the better the terms of agreeement which he must be offered in order to induce him to reach an agreement, and to compensate him for the risk involved.

Two theorems, which facilitate the computation and interpretation of the approximate slopes of most econometric tests, are established.

More precisely, if the support of the image measure is contained in a compact C^1 manifold (satisfying some technical conditions) which is of sufficiently low dimension relative to the number of commodities, then existence of completely revealing equilibria is generic.

Consequently the allocation of training resources among the young people of any generation depends upon the distribution of earnings among their parents.

The results indicate that fixed costs of work are of prime importance in determining the labor supply behavior of married women.

Each subproblem provides a ""price-consistent"" utility vector. The master problem determines a convex combination of the utility vectors generated at previous iterations. This convex combination mimimize the distance between the quantity-consistent and the price-consistent set.

By looking at the derived demand for labor, it is demonstrated that the analysis of the model can be reduced to the analysis of anequivalent model of pure exchange in which each country essentially trades its own labor of other countries. Furthermore unlike the case where the number of goods is finite, the derived demand for labor becomes a differentiable function of the relative wages of the different countries. How this facilitates the analysis of comparative statics exercises is illustrated by establishing number of propositions in the theory of growth, technical change, and tariffs.",Charles A.

The global properties and distinctive in that indifference loci are parallel surfaces, identical in shape and scale at all utility levels. These properties are potentially appropriate for models of family labor supply but are less suitable for applications to production over a wide range of output.

The optimality analysis brings out a surprising property of the games with hedonic coalitions, namely that transfers among coalitions may be necessary to attain Pareto optimality.

The behavior of each government agent is to choose a system of tariffs to maximize the estimated preferences of domestic consumers with a constraint on an estimated availability of commodities. We introduce an equilibrium concept so that (a) estimated preferences and an estimated available set of commodities are compatible with an observed state of the world economy and (b) a consumption bundle intended by each government agent coincides with a consumption bundle chosen by its domestic consumers.

The principal result is the characterization of a not necessarily convex ""region of no transactions"" for each period. If in any period the entering asset position is in this set, no transactions are made. Each point of the set side is the vertex of a cone such that if the entering asset position is outside the set, the optimal policy is to move to the vertex of the cone in which the entering asset position lies. It is shown that the region of no transactions is a connected set and that it is a cone when the utility function is assumed to be positively homogeneous.

Capitalists maximize profits subject to a capital constraint and workers are paid a subsistence wage. Equilibrium existence theorems are proved. In the second part, the welfare properties of the equilibria are examined--which, in the Marxian tradition, involve the notion of exploitation. It is shown that the possibility of exploitation is necessary and sufficient for all equilibria to sustain positive profits, if a certain technological condition holds. Finally, the notion of a subsistence bundle is dispensed with, and a Marxian determination of workers' consumption is proposed. In addition to placing the formal Marxian model into a general equilibrium context, the specification of production here is more general than the usual Leontief or von Neumann technologies: production sets are assumed to be only convex.",John E.

It is shown that in the case where only a single commodity price is stabilized, the consumer's preference for price instability depends upon four parameters: the income elasticity of demand for the commodity, the price elasticity of demand, the share of the budget spent on the commodity, and the coefficient of relative risk aversion. All of these parameters enter in an intuitive way and the analysis includes the conventional consumer's surplus approach as a special case. The analysis is extended to consider the benefits of stabilizing an arbitrary number of commodity prices.

Housing is normally regarded as a one-dimensional good and equilibrium in a city is mostly concerned with the land market rather than the housing market. This paper introduces, on the supply side, the concept of design parameters of a building and, on the demand side, the concept of housing attributes, i.e. multi-dimensional housing. By means of structural analysis an engineering cost function is obtained in terms of design parameters. Due to housing attributes, the demand for housing and the supply of housing, the latter being based on the engineering cost function, should be derived simultaneously. Equilibrium is defined on the housing market rather than on the land market. It is shown how in equilibrium housing rent, land rent design parameters on buildings, and population density all depend on distance from the center of the city and on parameters of the problem: income, city population, diameter of the city, and technical coefficients.",Hans-Jürgen Büttler and Martin J.

While those equations may be accurate for rural roads and expressways, they may be less accurate on city streets where delays at intersections are a dominant factor in congestion costs. This study replaces single speed-volume equations with a traffic simulation model that replicates the queuing of vehicles at traffic lights, the dispersion of platoons of vehicles as they move from one intersection to another, and the interaction of intersecting traffic flows on an urban street network. The model is used with actual Toronto road and traffic data to produce new estimates of congestion costs on specific streets during the morning rush hour. The model produces a surprisingly high average congestion cost during the morning rush hour and a poor correlation of the results with those that would be estimated for the same traffic flows by the single equation models. The simulation technique allows the calculation of congestion costs on a street-by-street basis, generating the detailed information that would be necessary for a complex congestion pricing scheme.",Donald N.

In other words, given almost any two points in the alternative space, it is possible to construct a majority path which starts at the first, and ends at the second. It is shown that for the intransitivities not to extend to the whole space in this manner, extremely restrictive conditions must be met on the frontier (or boundary) of the cycle set. Similar results are shown to hold for any social choice rule derived from a strong simple game. These results hold under fairly weak assumptions on individual preferences: individuals need only have continuous utility representations of their preferences such that no two individuals' preferences coincide locally. The results seem to rule out the possibility, at least in models of interest to economists, of using the transitive closure of the majority relation as a useful social choice function. They also imply that under any social choice rule meeting the conditions assumed here, it is generally possible to design agendas based on binary procedures which will arrive at virtually any point in the alternative space, even Pareto dominated points.",Richard D.

A key generalization of previous work is that we allow bequests to both male and female children so that each family receives two inheritances (one from the husband's parents and one from the wife's). This means the national distribution of wealth develops in a complicated manner depending on mating patterns. Using a fixed-point argument we prove the existence of a stationary distributionof wealth consistent with accurate expectations on the part of all households.

Certain properties of the economic mechanism permanently reproduce shortage. First we study the microanalytics of the producer firm. Efforts at increasing production may hit three different upper constraints: the constraints of physical resources, demand constraints, and the firm's budget constraint. The system can best be characterized according to which of these constraints is in effect. From this aspect resource-constrained and demand-constrained systems are discerned. In the former it is bottlenecks of production and not buyers' demand that delimit production; in the latter the case is the reverse. A socialist economy in its ""classical"" form belongs to the former type. This is connected with the question of whether the firm's budget constraint is ""hard"" or ""soft"". If it is hard, spending of the firm will be effectively delimited by its financial abilities. If it is soft, then because losses are almost automatically compensated by the state the firm's demand becomes almost insatiable. The macroanalytical part of the paper demonstrates the mechanism of a chronic shortage economy with the aid of a hydraulic analogy. In it the sector of firms ""pumps out"" the slack of the system. This phenomenon is due primarily to the effect of ""investment hunger"" shown to be the result of an irresistible expansion drive.

Managers of an individual subsystem within a large and complicated system use detailed information about their own subsystem and aggregated information (in some degree or other) about other subsystems.

For an integer d ≤ n, a d-majority equilibrium is an alternative x* ∈ X such that no alternative in X is preferred to x* by at least d individuals. It is proved that when X is a compact and convex set of dimension m, a necessary and sufficient condition that, for every profile of individuals' convex and continuous preferences, there exists a d-majority equilibrium, is that d be greater than (m/(m + 1))n. Using this result for the case when X consists of a finite number, T, of alternatives, it is shown that a necessary and sufficient condition that for every individuals' preference orderings there exists a d-majority equilibrium is that d exceeds ((T - 1)/T)n.",Joseph Greenberg,Joseph Greenberg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Various properties of these matrices are used to obtain, among other results, the reciprocity relations and general results on factor-price equalization.

Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling.",Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky,Daniel Kahneman,Amos Tversky,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The Budget constraint, redefined in terms of full income, appears as an argument in the wealth constraint, which in turn provides a way of introducing real money balances in the short run utility function without explicitly introducing prices in it. In the long run, prices do appear in the utility function, but their impact turns out to be negligible in practice. The generalized Stone-Geary utility function, on which the system is based, allows for both habit formation and stock effects. The demand for leisure, in the U.S., appears to be strongly habit forming, in the sense that the minimum number of leisure hours increases steadily over time in the short run and with the implication that adjustment to long run equilibrium is slow. In both runs, the supply of labor is slightly backward bending. The demand for transaction balances, on the contrary, does not display any dynamic behavior and is rather insensitive to changes in the rate of interest.",Louis Phlips,Louis Phlips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

In the context of a model developed by Drèze, the purpose of this paper is to describe more precisely the different states of the markets (excess supply or excess demand) that may occur near a competitive equilibrium. A general analytical picture is obtained, which associates with each state of the markets the region of the price domain where it prevails. This allows us to point out an important difficulty which arises in the local comparative statics of this class of model: local unicity is not warrantied, that is, there may exist price systems very close to some competitive price, for which all the fixed price allocations are far from the competitive allocation. Examples are shown in the macroeconomic model (two aggregate agents: households and firms, and three goods: money, output, and labor); necessary and sufficient conditions for local unicity are given in this context. They require that all commodities be Hicks-substitute for the consumer, which is another way of saying that both the marginal propensities for consumption and leisure are positive and smaller than one. On the other hand, assuming local unicity, one can look for the implications of the foregoing results for the long-run determination of prices. It is easy to show that, if the economy always reaches a fixed price allocation, an increase of the price of one commodity near the competitive equilibrium is always to the advantage of the sellers and to the disadvantage of the buyers. This suggests that the determination of prices should take the form of a struggle between buyers and sellers in each market.",Guy Laroque,Guy Laroque,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

This paper offers an axiomatization that explicitly recognizes the uncertainty of an individual's lifetime. It divides a horizon span into n periods and assumes that if death is not immediate then it will occur at the end of one of the periods. The theory is based on an unconditional preference relation over potential future consumption streams that accounts for uncertain lifetime, along with a conditional preference order that is based on the hypothesis that death will occur at the end of period i. There is a conditional order for each i from 1 to n. The utility representation involves an order-preserving utility function for each of the n conditional orders such that one potential consumption stream is unconditionally preferred to another if, and only if, the sum of the conditional utilities for the first stream exceeds the sum of the conditional utilities for the second.

The equations perform satisfactorily by conventional criteria; however, when disaggregated by frequency, it is found that the high and low frequency components appear to satisfy different models. The differences are generally significant suggesting that the model is misspecified and that another lag distribution should be used. In particular, the sum of the lag coefficients for labor inputs is substantially larger when estimated with the low frequency component than the high. Therefore, such a price equation estimated during a regime of continued wage inflation would exhibit a much larger long run output price elasticity with respect to wages, than would one estimated during a period of stable or randomly fluctuating wages.",Robert F.

If the two stage procedure gives the same answer as a single stage procedure, then Vartia calls the index number formula ""consistent in aggregation."" Paasche and Laspeyres indexes have this consistency in aggregation property, but these index number formulae are consistent only with very restrictive functional forms for the underlying aggregator (i.e., utility or production) function. The present paper shows that the class of superlative index number formulae has an approximate consistency in aggregation property, where a superlative index number formula is one which is consistent with a flexible functional form for the underlying aggregator function. The paper also contains some empirical examples which both illustrate the main theorem and also indicate that the chain principle for constructing index numbers is preferable to the fixed base method. Finally, the paper proves some theorems about the class of pseudo-superlative index numbers.",W. E. Diewert,W. E. Diewert,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The game is analogous to the familiar institution of competitive bidding in a sealed-tender auction in which one agent (the auctioneer) chooses among trades offered by the other agents (the bidders). Using various regularity assumptions it is shown that this noncooperative game has a Nash equilibrium which yields an allocation in the core of the corresponding cooperative game of exchange. Also, as the bidders are replicated by division this allocation (aggregated by types) converges to a Walrasian allocation in which each type's budget constraint (using the efficiency prices) is satisfied.

The estimates obtained are reasonable in both sign and magnitude and the dynamic character of fertility behavior is borne out by the finding that ordinary least squares estimates generally under- or over-estimate the total effects of changes in fertility determinants.

We have proposed in this paper a computationally feasible method of estimation not constrained by the independence restriction and which allows for a much richer range of human behavior than does the conditional logit model. An important characteristic of the model is provision for correlation among the random components of utility and, as a by-product, the explicit allowance for variation in tastes across individuals for the attributes of alternatives. We have demonstrated the model and compared it with the logit one by analyzing the travel mode choice decisions of commuters to the central business district of Washington, D.C.

The method overcomes some existing difficulties of applying Bayesian methods to medium size models. The method is applied to a small scale macro model. The prior information used stems from considerations regarding short and long run behavior of the model and form extraneous observations on empirical long term ratios of economic variables. Likelihood contours for several parameter combinations are plotted, and some marginal posterior densities are assessed by MC.",T. Kloek and H. K. van Dijk,T. Kloek,H.

The basic problem is that terminal capacities have to be consistent with terminal production requirements as given by the consumption targets, intermediate input requirements, and investment, where both the latter are treated endogenously. The basis for endogenous investment is (a) the assumption that the planning period as a whole is characterized by a set of constant sectoral growth rates and (b) the assumption that investment does not create any excess capacity. These two assumptions form the core of the notions of consistency and efficiency respectively. The method proposed is an integrated iterative procedure with endogenous revision of the division of sectors between those operating at full capacity (bottleneck) and the rest, output and investment levels, and rates of growth. The method is, in fact, a straightforward adaptation of the standard method of solving an IO model by power series expansion. The paper also discusses the method of target revision taken in conjunction with prior bounds on growth rates and certain aspects of the relation between investment and technology in the frame of the model proposed. It ends with a brief review of the literature, criticizing, in particular, the methods and approaches followed in a large number of applied planning models to tackle the set of issues discussed.",Sajal Lahiri,Sajal Lahiri,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

In consumer theory, this principle, with its identity with a maximal ordinal utility representation (without any regularity conditions), is implied by, or becomes equivalent for a non-satiable individual to, the (modified) strong axiom of revealed preference.

These theories may be classed into two types--those that treat preference (and hence choice) as a probabilistic phenomenon, and those that retain the deterministic structure of the traditional analysis but relax in some way the assumption that individual preference be transitive. In previous work other have examined the implications for economic equilibrium of asuming preferences to be random; our purpose in this paper is to examine the equilibrium implications of a particularly attractive deterministic choice theory, that of semiordered preferences. We first examine an exchange economy in which the agents' preferences are semiorders that are not too nonconvex; such an economy is shown to have an equilibrium, and further, for interior equilibria, it is shown that a range of allocations to consumers is consistent with equilibrium. Finally, we show that in a semiorder market economy the set of price equilibria has a non-empty interior relative to the price simplex.",Dean T. Jamison and Lawrence J. Lau,Dean T.

The current paper explains the rising cost of hospital care with the aid of an econometric model. the essence of the explanation is that the explosion of hospital cost reflects a rapid change in the quality and style of hospital care and not an increasing cost of providing the same product. The dramatic change in the quality of care is primarily due to the increased demand caused by the growth of private and public insurance. The paper presents an analytic of the hospital industry in which quality affectsthe demand for hospital services and in which the purchase or private insurance is endogenous. Estimates of key equations of the model based on a cross-section of time series for the individual states for the years 1958 through 1973 are presented.

Demand equations for inputs, formulated in terms of changes over time, are described in two steps. The first is the total input decision, which describes the Divisia input volume index in terms of the change in output (for cost minimization) or price changes (for profit maximization). The second is the input allocation decision, which describes the changes in the demand for the individual inputs in terms of the Divisia input volume index and the input price changes. It is shown that the input allocation decision allows a simple transformation so that (1) the change in the demand for each transformed input is independent of the changes in the relative prices of all others and (2) the log-change in output is the sum of certain components, each representing the contribution of one transformed input, in such a way that the interaction of these inputs is confined to terms of the third order of smallness.",Henri Theil,Henri Theil,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

It is shown that if utility is continuous in the product topology and if, in each period, expectations and the current constraint correspondence are continuous, then the current decision rule is upper semi-continuous. This result is obtained by associating with each current decision a set of feasible future plans. The expected utility of a current decision is then the expected utility of the best feasible future plan.

A model is developed in which many price distributions, each with a finite variance, satisfy the equilibrium requirements of rationality. Hence, the condition that the variance of the equilibrium price distribution be finite, or equivalently, that the conditionally expected price path be stable, does not guarantee uniqueness. In such cases it is shown that an arbitrary random quantity which is widely publicized can become a leading indicator of prices and, consequently, influence the behavior of actual prices. However, by extending the finite variance (stability) condition to a minimum variance condition, these nonuniqueness problems can be avoided. Such stability or minimum variance conditions suggest a kind of collective rationality which, although not unreasonable, has not yet been fully analyzed in rational expectations models.",John B.

The derived behavior shows how the firm, in response to price falls of increasing severity, will first reduce hours of work. After a minimum work week has been reached layoffs start. The point at which this occurs depends upon the income workers expect to receive if they are laid off. Since unemployment insurance (UI) benefits are an important determinant of this income level, they influence the number of layoffs. Given the absence of an effective incentive tax in practice, we would predict that the present UI system encourages layoffs. An effective, incentive tax could stop this encouragement. Two possible wage strategies are explored, both of which are consistent with the basic layoff and hours model. The flexible wage policy has the advantage of giving no incentive to the firm to default on the (privately) efficient layoff rules derived earlier, but seems to be inconsistent with observed short-run wage policy. The fixed wage policy has its strength and weakness the other way around.",Martin Neil Baily,Martin Neil Baily,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Properties of the final allocation are analyzed. It is shown that for every initial allocation there exists a Nash fiber, corresponding to the Nash allocation, that it is possible to determine the sign of the derivates of the final allocation with respect to changes in the threat point, and that a ""Slutsky-like"" equation relates these derivatives to the derivatives with respect to the initial allocation.

A strong result we obtain is that a systematic numerical inequality relationship exists; specifically, Wald @> LR @> LM. Since the equality relationship holds only if the null hypothesis is exactly true in the sample, in practice there will always exist a significance level for which the asymptotic Wald, LR, and LM tests will yield conflicting inference. However, when the null hypothesis is true, the dispersion among the test statistics will tend to decrease as the sample size increases.

A wide range of strategic behavior for consumers in their communication with the government is allowed; in particular, consumers may understate their preferences and be ""free riders"" if they choose. Although several examples of allocation-taxation schemes falling within the general model are discussed, the major contribution of the paper is the formulation of a particular government allocation-taxation scheme for which the behavioral equilibria are Pareto optimal. That is, given the government rules, consumers find it in their self-interest to reveal their true preferences for public goods.",Theodore Groves and John Ledyard,Theodore Groves,John Ledyard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Such restrictions limit the class of environments for which the organization is Pareto satisfactory. We show that a class of environments admits a Pareto satisfactory (and regular) resource allocation mechanism if and only if the graph of the Pareto correspondence is a union of continuous functions. We also study the shape of the Pareto set for a given environment and the way that set varies as the environment varies. We present examples showing that near any environment whose Pareto utility frontier is homeomorphic to a simplex there is whose Pareto frontier is badly chopped up. We also give an example of a class of environments for which the Pareto correspondence has no continuous selection through a given point.,Kenneth Mount and Stanley Reiter,Kenneth Mount,Stanley Reiter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The structure of a general neutral monotonic SDF is studied. It is shown to be characterized by the veto, if individual indifference is banned. With such indifference present, the characterization is by a veto structure, a hierarchy embracing all individuals. The reason for the interest in acyclicity [21, 22] is that it averts the voting paradox, permitting a choicefrom each subset of alternatives. This is for the finite case. When that assumption is dropped, an infinite ascending sequence of preferences prevents a choice. It is shown that this last phenomenon need not be prohibited along with cycles; the absence of such social sequences is implied by their absence from individual preferences.",Julian H.

Some basic restrictions on R are considered. First, if the ""at least as good as"" sets are closed, then none of the standard restrictions on R are shown to be necessary for the existence of a demand correspondence: the ""domination"" of finite sets is necessary and sufficient. This is shown to imply that acyclicity of R is necessary and sufficient for the existence of choice functions. Second, if either there is a restriction on convergent P monotone sequences or if R satisfies a regularity condition, then a condition on cyclical sets of alternatives is enough to guarantee the existence of demand correspondences. For the existence of rational choice functions, however, reflexivity, completeness, and transitivity of R, together with the above-mentioned condition on P-monotone sequences, are necessary and sufficient. Finally, if the strictly preferred sets are taken to be convex, then under a restriction weaker than the first, a best element in budget sets exists.",Anjan Mukherji,Anjan Mukherji,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Simple characteristics of the absolute risk aversion matrix R determine whether a utility function is additive or concave.

At present the most efficient known formulation is the minimum state variable representation, MSV. The LAG requires much less storage than the MSV as the LAG does not require conversion to state space representation. For short time horizons the LAG is computationally faster than the MSV.

In this model, the perceived price of care falls (following a nonlinear path) as the consumer approaches the deductible.

Furthermore, the spectral density function (SDF) of these residuals relative to that of a white noise series would be exaggerated at the high frequency portion and attenuated at the low frequency portion.

The illustration concerns an economy with both private and public goods (Section 2). It is shown (Section 3) how an efficient allocation for that economy can be reached through a globally stable process, combining a price-guided market allocation of private goods and a quantitative planning procedure for public goods.

The same ordering of projects is also induced by applying the overtaking criterion to the consumption steams.",John S. Chipman,John S. Chipman,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Various potential aggregates involving intrasectoral and intersectoral, as well as full aggregation are discussed in connection with the various aggregation procedures. It will be shown that the satisfaction of the Gorman conditions allows for full aggregation within a general equilibrium model of production. We shall derive new conditions for aggregation using a composite commodity approach that appears to be somewhat weaker than the conditions associated with restrictions-on-functional-form theorems. Our main conditions relate to the equality of sectoral labor shares. The data for testing those conditions appear to be readily available. It is shown that the equal labor share condition can be applied to models with joint and nonjoint products. In addition, the conditions for aggregation are derived for a model with many primary inputs and also for a model with unequal rates of depreciation. Two sections are devoted to the main correspondences between certain aggregation procedures in the literature from the point of view of a general equilibrium model. The implications of our analysis for the form of the unit cost function and of the aggregate production function are discussed.

The purpose of this paper is to show that the correlation structures and the autoregressive moving average representations of a number of Australian quarterly time series extracted from the income accounts are relatively insensitive to data revision. The same is true of the cross correlation functions between the ""pre-whitened"" series.",John McDonald,John McDonald,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

It is found that the least squares certainty equivalence rule converges to its true value with probability one and is asymptotically efficient, having an asymptotic distribution with a variance as small as any other strongly consistent rule. However, while a linear combination of the parameter estimates is consistent, the evidence does not confirm that the individual estimates themselves are consistent. If these converge to their true values at all, they do so very slowly (on the order of (log t)^-^1).",T. W. Anderson and John B. Taylor,T. W. Anderson,John B. Taylor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

It is shown that homogeneity and separability are compatible with both the direct and indirect utility functions,but that direct and indirect additivity is consistent with only limited classes of utility functions. Samuelson has raised the question of whether there exists a nontrivial self-dual preference ordering which requires more stringent conditions than homogeneity and separability. By a self-dual preference is meant a preference ordering such that the direct utility function is exactly identical with the corresponding indirect utility function The purpose of this paper is to present a complete solution to the problem of self-duality. First, we elaborate on the necessary and sufficient conditions for an ""exactly"" or ""strongly"" self-dual utility function (in Samuelson's sense). Then, using some well-known concepts of the continuous group theory of transformations, we study the case of ""weakly"" self-dual preference orderings and give a precise formulation of the concept of the ""same"" mathematical form.

A Partial Congruence Axiom (""every non-empty finite collection of feasible sets has an alternative which is in the choice set of every feasible set in the collection which contains that alternative"") is shown to be necessary and sufficient for weak order representability when all choice sets are finite.

The local characterization results in an interesting finding. With the systems of effective constraints which restrict only as man involved variables as the number of constraints, the variations of an extremum system, as consequences of changes in parametric indices of exogeneous conditions, will be only quantitative. With the systems of effective constraints which restrict more or all the involved variables, however, the consequential variations will be qualitative as well as quantitative. Necessary and sufficient conditions are investigated for constrained saddle points to exhibit a generalized Le Chatelier-Samuelson principle. An economic argument along the lines of demand theory is that the generalized principle among constrained demands is established if and only if the Jacobian of the constrained demands with effective constraints exhibits a dominant complementarity for the new constraint with its coefficients non-negative. The Marshallian conjectures about short run and long run are extensively discussed and rigorously proved with the results.",Sho-Ichiro Kusumoto,Sho-Ichiro Kusumoto,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

For common stocks these distributions (of which the distribution of Δ log p is a mixture) appear to have a pronounced excess of frequency near the mean and a deficiency of outliers, relative to the normal.

We estimate return-to-normality and error-learning forecasting models and inquire whether such equations can be interpreted simply as reduced forms of an autoregressive forecasting structure. Assuming that respondents' expectations were formed rationally in the sense of Muth, a series of tests lead us to reject the hypothesis of a purely autoregressive forecasting structure. Placed in the context of the return-to-normality model, the decisive evidence consists both of significantly nonzero intercepts and of important variations in survey respondents' anticipated normal rates of inflation that cannot be explained as a reduced-form reflection of past variation in observed inflation rates. These findings indicate that information not collinear with past realizations of price-level change plays an important role in the forecasting process, important enough to allow expected near-term rates of inflation to follow observed inflation rates more closely than autoregressive time series models would suggest.",Edward J.

Although spectral methods proposed by Hannan will always be asymptotically efficient, they are frequently used because they are computationally demanding and very large samples are presumably required. This paper presents Monte Carlo evidence from a variety of typical econometric situations which indicates that the estimators perform quite well for moderate-sized samples (100) when the error process is highly dependent, and even for small samples when the error process is simple.

In contrast to much of the previous literature, this paper makes a distinction between the aggregate level patterns of voting and the individual level variables which bring them about. By so doing the assumptions can focus on objects which have a more direct empirical referent, namely, the aggregate level support function and the distribution of ideal points. Using this approach, sufficient conditions are found for the existence of equilibrium which, although themselves strong, make considerably weaker demands on individuals than have been generally assumed in the literature. Thus, it is not necessary that each voter vote strictly with regard to policy but, rather, it is sufficient that in the electorate as a whole there is a moderate amount of policy related voting. Other results of the analysis are that policy related voting of any type seems to encourage candidates to converge towards the center, with support from extremists only accentuating this tendency. It is the candidate's most loyal supporters who seem to have the least influence over his policy position.",Richard D. McKelvey,Richard D. McKelvey,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

But the shape of the spatial competitive market deamnd curve is shown to depend upon the behavioral assumptions used in the competitive. Three basically different competitive models are presented with contrasting results. Elasticity and price effects under each type of competition are determined and evaluated as is the effect of spatial competition on prices.

These restrictions provide the basis of a test of the structure using only the unrestricted reduced form parameter estimates. Under H<sub>0</sub> the test proposed is asymptotically equivalent to a likelihood ratio test. The test may be applied as a single equation or complete system procedure and it may be presented as either a χ <sup>2</sup> or an F statistic. The case is also made here for system overidentification tests rather than single equation procedures, the arguments being drawn from the statistical literature on hypothesis testing by induction. The computational advantages of the present proposals are substantial when compared to FIML based likelihood ratio tests and Monte Carlo experiments confirm that a system version of the test performs well in large samples. The system version of the test behaves like the FIML likelihood ratio test in large sample situations both under H<sub>0</sub> and H<sub>1</sub>. However, the Monte Carlo studies indicate that both the single equation and system versions of the test perform poorly in small samples.",R. P. Byron,R. P. Byron,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Our extension of the equilibrium concept to the oligopoly model is founded on recent generalizations of Shapley's stochastic game.

This can lead to biased estimates of the covariance matrix of the regression coefficients. Since such bias is difficult to eliminate completely, its sensitivity to alternatives estimates of error covariances is studies by Watson, Theil, Malinvaud, and others with the help of bounds on the bias derived under certain assumptions. This paper gives similar bounds under less restrictive assumptions, and illustrates them context of heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation problems. In particular, for the first order error autocorrelation coefficient of ρ the upper bound on proportionate bias is shown to be reasonably approximated by (1 + ρ)/(1 - ρ) - 1.",S. T. Sathe and H. D.

As well as testing the various forms of the ""Rotterdam"" model, reparametrization of that system is carried out in order to test the linear expenditure system and the direct addilog system on an exactly comparable basis. A further variant of the Rotterdam model is also introduced; this is intermediate between symmetry and additivity and allows for the calculation of all cross price elasticities from information on own price and income elasticities alone. The results of testing these models on a nine commodity model using maximum likelihood estimation are presented and discussed. Unlike most previous work, and in spite of some anomalous results, the United Kingdom experience seems broadly consistent with neoclassical demand theory. However, all restrictions more stringent than those directly implied by the theory are rejected, though it is maintained that these may still be of considerable practical significance in particular instances.",Angus S.

It is shown that if, as is usual, we take the significance point equal to the 5 per cent point or 10 per cent point, the risk is extremely large for some parameter value. The optimal significance point of the preliminary t test decreases slightly as the degrees of freedom increase,but it is nearly constant; i.e., it lies between 1.370 to 1.380 if d.f. is greater than 6.",Takamitsu Sawa and Takeshi Hiromatsu,Takamitsu Sawa,Takeshi Hiromatsu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The main results are roughly as follows. (i) Demand is differentiable and the Slutsky equation holds for almost all prices if demand satisfies a Lipschitz condition in income (except possibly for a closed cone of prices of measure zero) and utility is concave. This includes the homothetic case which is given special attention in Section 4. (ii) For the Slutsky equation to indicate demand behavior in the large, it is sufficient that along any given indifference curve the ratio of changes in price to changes in quantity be bounded from zero (Section 5). (iii) Even with almost everywhere differentiable demand derived from continuously differentiable utility, most change in demand does not necessarily take place where the Slutsky equation is valid (Section 5). (iv) By way of proof of Theorems 1-3, it is shown that the maximand in a Lagrange problem is differentiable under appropriate conditions on the function being maximized (Theorem 6, Section 3, and Appendix). (v) For preferences as in (ii) and for almost all wealths, equilibrium is locally unique (Section 6).",Trout Rader,Trout Rader,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The intercept estimator may be inconsistent even when the slope estimators are consistent; for the intercept estimator to be consistent it is sufficient that the slope estimators are consistent and, in addition, the expected value of the proportional error in the reciprocal of the deflator is zero. When there is inconsistency, the estimated regression tends to indicate a proportional relationship between the dependent ratio variable and each of the independent ratio variables (an important application of this result concerns the estimation of distributed lag accelerator relationships). Given assumptions about the distribution of error in the deflator, consistent estimators can be evaluated; an empirical application suggests that, as a rule, inconsistency is small even when the errors in the deflator are quite large.",M.

The major reason is that now not only wealth, but also the composition of wealth, becomes important in the decision making process. To keep the exposition reasonably manageable we consider only a constant relative risk averse utility function and confine explicit attention to a two-period horizon. Since it is now necessary to examine portfolio choices in detail, we limit portfolio opportunities to a riskless asset, cash, and a risky asset, stock, with a random return.

The axioms consist of extensions of the Herstein-Milnor [11] axioms for ""measurable"" utility, a generalization of an averaging condition in Bolker [4], and several structural conditions. The structural conditions are examined in some detail, and examples are given to show what happens to the numerical model when they do not hold. The numerical model expresses the utility of an act (or mixed act), given an event, as a weighted sum of the utilities of the act given events that partition the initial event, the weights being personal probabilities for the partition events conditioned on the initial event. The theory is compared to Savage's theory [18] and to a version of the theory of Luce and Krantz [14] for conditional expected utility.",Peter C. Fishburn,Peter C.

Perhaps the most serious econometric problem faced when dealing with a differential equation system is the practical difficulty of finding consistent estimates of the important structural parameters. In this paper a simple three-equation Phillips model is considered and consistent estimates of the structural parameters are provided by the minimum-distance procedure. The small-sample distributions of these estimates are investigated by the Monte Carlo method; and the results are then compared with those of the three-stage least-squares estimates found by making a discrete approximation to the system of differential equations.,P.

The restriction of an allocation to the atomless sector is called competitive if there exists a price vector such that the consumption of every ""small"" trader is a maximal element (in terms of his preference) in the budget set defined by that price vector and by his initial endowment.

The economic model is a restricted consumer choice model, where the mutually exclusive collectively exhaustive choice is between auto driver and transit passenger. The main testable hypothesis is that, in the absence of knowledge about the value a traveler attaches to his time, if a choice exists and if a mode is cheaper than the alternative in terms of both time and money, it should be chosen. The hypothesis was subjected to empirical analysis and, within the limits of the data, appeared to be a good approximation to reality. The statistical model used to further investigate the data was discrimination-classification analysis. The discriminant function can be interpreted as an indifference hypersurface of the indirect or constrained utility function. The statistical theory underlying the three versions of the model used is presented along with a derivation of the elasticity of choice. The data were a subset of the Bay Area Transportation Study Commission origin and destination home interview data merged with interzonal travel times and costs of both modes. Trips were stratified by purpose. Elasticities were calculated and compared both within a purpose by different variables and between purposes for each variable.

Under the assumption that all predetermined variables in the model are exogenous, necessary and sufficient conditions are obtained for the existence of even moments of the above estimators. It is shown that for the general case with an arbitrary number of included endogenous variables, even moments of the 2SLS estimator are finite if and only if the order is less than K2 - G1 + 1. Furthermore, even moments of the OLS estimator exist if and only if the order is less than N - K1 - G1 + 1, where N is the sample size, G1 + 1 is the number of included endogenous variables, K1 and K2 respectively are the number of included and excluded exogenous variables in the equation to be estimated.",Roberto S.

Moreover, we assume that the system contains no lagged endogenous variables and disturbance terms of each period are independently distributed as multivariate normal. The exact finite-sample moments of the k-class estimators are evaluated for 0 @< k < 1. For k > 1 it is proved that the estimator does not possess even the first-order moment. The exact moment functions are expanded in terms of the inverse of the noncentrality (or concentration) parameter. This expansion sheds more light on the comparative study of alternative k-class estimators.

The numbers of outputs and of factor inputs are allowed to be unmatched. The domestic factor prices in a country facing the international commodity prices are uniquely determined in the neoclassical framework once the factor endowment is taken as given. This allows the factor-price equalization proposition to maintain the invariance of the derivatives of the social production possibility schedule with respect to input parameter perturbations, considering the possible repercussions in the outputs. A necessary and sufficient condition for this invariance is presented in terms of second derivatives of the social production possibility frontier with its economic interpretation. This condition is applied to the non-joint production case. The paper asserts that the equalization theorem holds true if the constant-returns to scale production functions are strictly concave except along rays and satisfy the full-rank condition on the input-coefficient matrix, and if the number of commodities is no less than that of factors. Several other varieties are also presented including the joint production case.",Kiyoshi Kuga,Kiyoshi Kuga,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The general problem is that in the absence of an equilibrium condition the ex ante demand and supply quantities cannot in general be equated to the observed quatity traded in the market. Four methods of estimation, differing primarily in their use of information on price-setting behavior, are developed in this paper. The first method is a generalization of an earlier meothd developed by R. Quandt and is based upon the maximization of a likelihood function. The method does not require any specific assumption about price-setting behavior, and it allows the sample separation (into demand and supply regimes) to be estimated along with the coefficient estimates. The second and third methods use the change in price as a qualitative proxy in determining the sample separation. The fouth method uses the change in price as a quantitative proxy for the amount of excess demand (supply) in the market. In the final section of the paper the four methods are used to estimate a a model of the housing and mortgage market in an effort to gauge the potential usefulness of each of the methods.",Ray C.

If it is left to the individual customer to decide whether to join the queue or not, he will balk whenever the queue length is greater than some number, say n1. It is shown that if a balking level n2 < n1 is enforced, then the customers as a group can generally expect a larger net benefit per time unit than when the balking level n1 is applied. One way to ensure social optimality is to impose a toll on the customers who join the queue. In the discussion of a possible economic interpretation of the model we point out the similarities between such a toll and a shadow price in a more conventional optimization model.

In contrast to previous discussions, users and producers of transportation service (passengers and airlines) are explicitly distinguished. In the first version of the model, ticket prices are assumed--unrealistically--to be flexible and competitively determined; then perfect optimality is attainable by imposing an appropriate toll either on airlines or on passengers. In the more realistic second version of the model, ticket price is fixed above the competitive level. In the absence of a toll, there are two inefficiencies: the level of transportation is non-optimal, and it is produced inefficiently, using partially loaded airplanes. An appropriate toll on airlines can do much to correct both of these inefficiencies, and is always superior to the best toll on passengers.",Rolla Edward Park,Rolla Edward Park,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Initial investment and borrowing are control parameters; and the scale of capacity use is the control variable. Investment costs, which reflect the ""six-tenths"" rule in particular, are nonconvex. Special considerations are thus involved in deriving the investment and borrowing rules. It is shown that the optimum must be at one of the following three points: (i) no investment and no borrowing, (ii) investment of just the endowment, and (iii) investment of the maximum amount possible. This result is especially important computationally, because the problem is convex at the points described by (ii) and (iii), and trivial at the origin.

It is based on an interpretation of the Leontief model in the framework of a general model of capital accumulation of the Walras-Hicks type. A particular case of such a model, corresponding to the hypothesis of static expectations, turns out to be the competitive capital theory underlying the Leontief model. This theory, capable of defining a meaningful equilibrium even when the Leontief equilibrium based onfull employment of all stocks is not possible, allows us to overcome the difficulty in retaining the economic interpretation of solutions. In the terminology of Hicks (Capital and Growth), this theory solves the problem of the traverse between two full employment equilibria. It will be evident, contrary to current opinion, that output levels and prices are indissolubly connected also inside the Leontief model. Finally, Solow's prices, which give rise to the striking ""dual stability paradox,"" will be discussed. The ultimate reason for such a paradox will be identified as an intrinsic inconsistency in the assumption of correct expectations on which these prices are based.",Enrico Zaghini,Enrico Zaghini,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Very often we would like to use such data to study behavioral relationships that are dynamic in character, i.e., that contain a distributed lag or other form of autogressive relationship. Since only a few observations are available over time, but a great many observations are available for different individuals at a point in time, it is exceptionally important to make the most efficient use of the data across individuals to estimate that part of the behavioral relationship containing variables that differ substantially from one individual to another, in order that the lesser amount of information over time can be used to best advantage in the estimation of the dynamic part of the relationship studied. As it turns out, the problem is far from simple: obvious devices such as the pooling of all observations and estimation by ordinary least squares, or the introduction of dummy variables for individuals, produce estimates having serious small sample bias. In earlier papers, the author and others have formulated a simple variance components model for the disturbance term in a relationship to be estimated from cross section data over time. This paper presents a series of Monte Carlo studies designed to explore the small sample properties of various types of estimates within this context. Not only is the bias of the obvious methods of estimation mentioned above confirmed, but certain serious deficiencies of the maximum likelihood approach which had been suspected earlier are also confirmed.

Unfortunately, their formulation does lead to a ""natural"" interpretation of the generalized least squares estimates, or of the relationships of these estimates to other estimates in the same way diagonalization of the variance-covariance matrix by means of an appropriate orthogonal transformation does. The characteristic roots of the variance-covariance matrix for the disturbances in a three component model which has been studied by Wallace and Hussain are derived here. It is shown how knowledge of these roots and the characteristic vectors associated with them leads to a form of the inverse matrix which may be more readily interpreted, as well as a number of other useful results, including an interpretation of the poor small sample properties of estimates which incorporate dummy variables for each individual.",Marc Nerlove,Marc Nerlove,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

In the model the objective of the firm is to maximize, subject to various constraints, the integral of production profits less interest and investment costs over a finite decision-making interval, plus the value of the capacity at the end of the period. The state variables are capacity, debt, and output price; the controls are the scale of operation, rate of purchase of new capacity, and rate of change of the output price. Final capacity, price, and debt are control parameters. There are several inequality constraints. Using results in control theory, the optimal controls are characterized for a model basically linear in structure. It shows that the one case suggested by Evans for further analysis is a trivial problem. These results are interpreted using the properties of the value equation. In addition, the control model is formulated alternatively as a mathematical programming problem. Solutions may then be computed by publishing algorithms.","Russell G. Thompson, Melvin D.

Ordinary statistical tests could then be applied in testing the alternative hypotheses.

The proof is important because it permits the formulation of spatial equilibrium problems in terms of either the quantity domain or the price domain. The equivalence is then used to establish the mutually dual quadratic problems in quantify and price separately.

Similar analyses using artificially generated time series have also been attempted. The effects, desirable or undesirable, of a particular method of seasonal adjustment can, however, only be assessed properly in the time domain and only in relation to the objectives of such adjustment. Despite the fact that such objectives have not been clearly formulated nor any definitive conception of the nature of seasonality developed, in this paper we do adopt a general approach consistent with what has been written on the subject since the time of Jevons. In terms of a simple three component model of an economic time series having properties similar to those found in many actual time series, we devise several ""methods"" of seasonal adjustments based on a minimum mean-square-error criterion of optimality. We show that such methods of seasonal adjustment produce seasonally adjusted series bearing the same relationship to the unadjusted series in spectral terms as that found by Nerlove and others in their studies of BLS and Census methods of adjustment. Our conclusion is not that spectral methods are useless, but rather that comparisons in the frequency domain must be interpreted with great care. Further research must emphasize objectives and models. Whether these are formulated in frequency terms or in the time domain is of secondary importance.",D. M. Grether and M. Nerlove,D. M. Grether,M.

Properties of the distance function of a production structure are studied and are related to properties of the correspondence. Homotheticity is generalized to allow discontinuities in returns to scale and to take cognizance of several outputs. The factorization of the distance function into the product of two functions, one depending only on output and the other only on input, is demonstrated. The cost function is then shown to give rise to a production structure. A Shephard-type duality theorem is proven which implies, among other things, that the cost function and the distance function are dually related; that is, given one, a minimization proglem yields the other. The duality theorem is then used to deduce necessary and sufficient conditions, in terms of the cost function, for a production correspondence to be homothetic. A few simple applications of the duality theorem are given which relate properties of the cost function to geometric properties of the correspondence.",S. E. Jacobsen,S. E.

It is shown that the asymptotic distribution of the lag-1 serial correlation coefficient calculated from the least-squares residuals differs from that of the coefficient calculated from the true disturbances. A consequence of this is that tests of serial independence based on the residuals from regression on fixed regressors are invalid when applied to models containing lagged dependent variables even when the null hypothesis of serial independence is true.

In general, the total payoff will depend on the value of a random variable that is unknown at the time of the decision making. The payoffs are assumed to be in monetary terms while there is no restriction on the transfer of money between parties. This paper determines the sufficient conditions under which the cooperative decisions can be ordered according to their corresponding Pareto optimal fronts. The same ordering of the decisions can be obtained on the basis of the expected utility of a group, which has a particular utility function for the total payoff and probability distribution for the random variable.

The Kuhn-Tucker conditions and the dual to the transportation model are used to derive optimal conditions for this problem. These conditions are shown to be both necessary and sufficient if the production costs are convex at each plant, and are necessary otherwise. An algorithm is developed for reaching an optimal solution to the production-transportation problem for the convex case. This algorithm utilizes a decomposition approach. It iterates between a linear programming transportation problem which optimally allocates previously set plant production quantities to various markets and a routine which optimally sets plant production quantities to equate total marginal production costs including a shadow price representing the relative location cost determined from the transportation problem.","J.

The data for empirical verification, however, may not, and usually do not, meet the underlying assumptions. In this paper the effects of differences in the wage-rental ratios between the two sectors are traced. Let q<sub>j</sub> be the wage-rental ratio in sector j; the paper deals with distortions of the kind <tex-math>$q_{1}=\gamma q_{2}$</tex-math>. The admissible values for q<sub>1</sub> and q<sub>2</sub> are derived as functions of γ and the overall capital-labor ratio (k). Theorem 1 states the values of γ for which the sign of the difference in capital intensities is (i) preserved and (ii) reversed. Next we establish conditions under which the sign of the difference in factor shares is (i) in line with that of no distortion, (ii) reversed, (iii) a combination of (i) and (ii). Such conditions depend not only on γ and k but also on the elasticities of substitution (ES) in the two sectors. Theorem 2 summarizes the discussion on this subject. The proofs of the proposition leading to Theorems 1 and 2 are illustrated graphically. In order to analyze the effect on the sign of the supply function in this economy, the ES of products with respect to their prices is expressed in terms of the parameters of the individual production functions. The expression shows clearly the augmentation effect observed by Johnson [1] (i.e., in the absence of distortion, the ES between products is larger than those which exist between factors).

This paper shows through examples that the Nagar approach can be misleading in the sense that it can yield an estimate for finite sample bias that differs from the true finite sample bias to the same order of sample size. And it can yield estimates of bias which are finite (infinite) while the true bias is infinite (finite). The paper also draws attention to some of the pitfalls to be avoided in studying the properties of an infinite sequence of random variables.",T. N. Srinivasan,T. N.

Goodness of fit and absence of autocorrelation of errors are used as a basis for comparison of the performance of the alternative models. The econometric models are compared with each other and with alternative explanations of data on investment based on surveys of anticipated investment and on mechanical forecasting schemes. The four econometric models included in our study are those of Anderson [2], Eisner [15], Jorgenson and Stephenson [38], and Meyer and Glauber [46]. On the basis of our comparison, the ranking of the alternative models is as follows: (1) Jorgenson-Stephenson, (2) Eisner, (3) Meyer-Glauber, (4) Anderson. Anticipatory data give a better fit to data on investment expenditures than that provided by any of the econometric models. Mechanical forecasting schemes provide a fit that is superior to the Anderson and Meyer-Glauber models. These schemes are slightly inferior to the Eisner model and clearly inferior to the Jorgenson-Stephenson model. The alternative econometric models included in our comparison differ in specification of the time structure of the investment process and in the role ascribed to specific determinants of investment behavior. Both aspects of an econometric model affect its performance so that it is difficult to discriminate among alternative determinants of investment behavior on the basis of our results.","Dale W.

Predictive performance may be assessed in two ways: (i) We compare prediction errors for a period of prediction with errors for a period of fit. (ii) We fit investment functions for both periods and test for structural change. These two procedures may be viewed as alternative tests of the hypothesis of structural change; the second is more powerful from the statistical point of view. Test of predictive performance supplement the comparisons of alternative models given in our preceding paper [17]. Goodness of fit may be exaggerated by consideration of a wide range of alternatives and selection of the one that fits best. If goodness of fit is exaggerated, a predictive test should produce evidence of structural change between the period of fit and the period of prediction. Of course, the better an econometric model fits the data, the more stringent this criterion for predictive performance. The econometric models included in our study are those of Anderson [1], Eisner [7], Jorgenson and Stephenson [19], and Meyer and Glauber [21]. On the basis of predictive performance the ranking of the alternative models is as follows: (1) Eisner, (2) Jorgenson-Stephenson, (3) Meyer-Glauber, and (4) Anderson. This ranking is similar to that resulting from comparisons based on goodness of it presented in our preceding paper [17]. For econometric models of quarterly investment behavior, the models that fit the best also have the best predictive performance.","Dale W. Jorgenson, Jerald Hunter and M. Ishag Nadiri",Dale W.

This study attempts to assess the veracity of the notion that there is such an effect of expectations. We begin with the premise that any change in expectations about future net cash accruing to business enterprises really reflects changes in expectations about future economic conditions in general, and that changes in expectations about future cash flows will be reflected in the discounted present value of business firms and hence the market value of equity shares. After removing systematic components from such data, and analysis of the random component strongly suggests that there is an ""announcement effect"" on expectations associated with discount rate changes, and that there seems to be a consensus as to what the inferred information content of such changes portends for future economic conditions. Also, on days immediately preceding discount rate decreases, there seems to be come evidence of anticipation of the change.",Roger N. Waud,Roger N. Waud,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Road expansion in congested cities often seems to achieve nothing but more congestion. This paper demonstrates how this arises as a process of market equilibrium, and how one can assess the benefits of the road expansion in this situation.

It is shown, for instance, that if the individual is to be risk neutral at all incomes and price ratios in a given neighborhood, the income-consumption curves must be linear, and if all income-consumption curves are linear, there exists a cardinal representation of utility which is linear in income. The cases of constant relative risk aversion, constant absolute risk aversion, and quadratic utility functions are also investigated.",Joseph E. Stiglitz,Joseph E.

The Kennedy innovation possibility frontier is employed to describe the opportunities available to the firm for factor augmentation and from it the direction of factor augmentation can be chosen. In addition, this opportunity curve can be shifted inwards or outwards according to the expenditure on research and development. The selection of the direction and extent of technical change is first determined via a myopic decision rule and then by maximization of the present value of the stream of net revenue from production and sale of output less the cost of technical advance. In the latter problem the maximum principle of Pontryagin is employed. Questions regarding the existence of stationary states and stability are resolved, and the optimal solutions are compared with the myopic decision rules.",M. I. Kamien and N. L. Schwartz,M. I.

Mostly small effects are found for choice of index formula, base year, logarithmic versus linear form, definition of food consumption (e.g., physical versus expenditure measure), procedures related to time, and aggregation. However, the supply elasticity of food is found to be identifiable and to have a value greater than many have believed, providing a basis for deciding whether to favor demand estimates based on consumption-dependent or price-dependent regressions. The most frequently used deflators are inconsistent with the Slutsky-Schultz relation. Estimates are developed of three types of bias due to improper deflation (weight of food in deflator, correlation of deflator with residual, and formula nonconformities).","G. S. Tolley, Y.

On the one hand there is the evolution relative to experimental situations, for experiments yield reproducible knowledge and new results can therefore be used for forecasting as soon as they are established. Within nonexperimental forecasting, on the other hand, there is the evolution from the largely passive forecasts that are typical in demography over to the operative forecasts in terms of instruments and targets that are the aspiration, difficult to materialize with success, of the multirelational forecasting models of modern econometrics. The econometric developments confirm the general experience that scientific evolution is never a straightforward affair. To solve new types of problems requires a reorientation of the analysis, sometimes a sharp turn from the old tracks, and the sharper the turn the more confused and controversial is the accompanying debate. As briefly reviewed in my Address, econometrics has been pathbreaking in several fundamental developments connected with forecasting, included the transition from exact to stochastic relations, from descriptive to explanatory analysis, and from unirelational to multirelational model building.",Herman O.

It can be shown that the cross spectrum between two variables can be decomposed into two parts, each relating to a single causal arm of a feedback situation.

It is shown in this paper that the estimates themselves--not just their large sample efficiency--are unaffected if one follows the above mentioned simplified procedure. This result is established for the general case of a simultaneous equation system subject to linear homogeneous a priori restrictions, whereas many other known properties of the three stage least squares method have been demonstrated only for the special case of ""simple restrictions"" on the structural coefficients.

For known variances, it is shown that Aitken estimators and covariance estimators are in one sense asymptotically equivalent, even though the Aitken estimators are more efficient in small samples. Turning to unknown variance components, Zellner-type iterative estimators are compared with covariance estimators. Here, few small sample properties are obtained. However, it is shown that covariance and Zellner-type estimators have equivalent asymptotic distributions and equivalent limits of sequences of first and second order moments for weakly nonstochastic regressors. For the model analyzed, the theoretical results obtained, as well as ease of computation, tend to support traditional covariance estimators of the regression parameters. An additional interesting result presented in an appendix is that ordinary least squares estimates of the β's (ignoring the error components) have unbounded asymptotic variances. On efficiency grounds, this argues rather strongly for some care in combining data from alternative sources in regression analysis.",T. D. Wallace and Ashiq Hussain,T. D.

One member of this family is the Newton-Raphson method and another member, obtained from a generalization of Steffensen's method to a system of equations, has been considered in [7]. The general member of the family is derived from a regula falsi construction, due to Gauss, for a particular choice of points in the iteration. From the computational point of view, all the members of the family of iterations, except the Newton-Raphson method, have the property that the partial derivatives of the system of equations are used almost never if a computing device with unlimited precision is utilized. Further, the asymptotic speed of convergence for any member is at least of order two. In view of the difficulties of obtaining the functional form of the second order partials of the likelihood function for general linear and nonlinear simultaneous systems, the method proposed here may be recommended in the computation of full information maximum likelihood estimates. Even if the partials of the system of equations are easily calculated, then some member of the family may still lead to convergence if the Newton-Raphson method does not. Practically speaking, the proposed method can be used to determine an approximate solution and this approximate solution will be closer to the solution if the precision of the computations is higher.",Leon L.

The author studies the case of two existing, perfectly substitutable facilities, namely a turnpike and a highway, connecting two given locations. It is well known that an optimal resource allocation can be attained only by levying a toll on users during congested hours. These tolls must be such that the private cost of the trip on each facility is equal to its marginal social cost. In practice, however, there are often constraints that prevent reaching this goal. Thus, what is the optimal toll to be charged on the turnpike, when it is impossible to levy a toll on the high way? We owe the answer to this question to Lévy-Lambert. The purposes of the present note are: (i) to derive explicitly Lévy-Lambert's result from a general equilibrium model and in the process to exhibit a minor qualification; (ii) to derive a few additional results, especially about the optimal redistribution of incomes; and (iii) to illustrate by a simple example a general methodology for analyzing ``second best'' models, already used with success in other fields.",Maurice Marchand,Maurice Marchand,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Marginal distributions of the parameters have been obtained for Haavelmo's data. Then the predictive probability density of the model is derived for given values of the exogenous variable, investment. In order to check some of the specifying assumptions, the model is expanded and analyzed under the assumption that the error terms are generated by a first order autoregressive scheme. Exact finite sample results are obtained and the posterior distributions are computed for Haavelmo's data. Conditional distributions of the parameters of the model are computed for given values of the autocorrelation parameter, ρ, in order to assess the effects of departures from our specifying assumptions. Another specifying assumption that is examined concerns the exogenous nature of investment. For this, Haavelmo's model II, in which investment is assumed to be endogenous, is used. Posterior distributions of the parameters of the model are computed for this model. The sensitiveness of the inference about the parameters of the model to the assumption that investment is exogeneous is studied by computing various conditional distributions for model II. It is seen that this assumption is very crucial for Haavelmo's data. Finally, two different prior distributions reflecting two different views about investment are introduced.

In general, real factors rather than monetary phenomena are emphasized. There has been little success in developing a theory of capital accumulation and growth which unites Keynesian marginal efficiency and liquidity preference concepts. Instead, full employment is often made a precondition of the analysis. Tobin has, at least, attempted to study the relationship between money and growth but his system is defective since it omits the construction of a demand for capital schedule by entrepreneurs that can be formulated independently of the savings propensity and portfolio decisions of households. (An independent investment demand function--the essence of the static Keynesian system--is often omitted in growth analysis.) This paper shows Tobin's model is applicable only to nonmonetary Say's Law economies, and attempts to remedy the defects of such an analysis. In a modern monetary, market-oriented economy, full employment is likely to be neither automatic nor a position of stable equilibrium (as Phillips curves imply a highly unstable full employment price level). To assume full employment as a precondition is to remove the problem of the role of the money supply in the process of accumulation and growth from the real world. This paper presents an analysis which allows the examination of the role of money within the context of a Keynesian system permitting independent savings, investment and liquidity preference functions.

It was found that the optimal choice depends on the initial technology, relative factor prices, and relative costs of acquiring different types of technical change. The preferred technical change need not be exclusively of one sort (e.g., ""neutral"" change). Once ""neutral"" technical change becomes optimal, however, it remains so until there is a change in relative factor prices. On the other hand, adoption of a ""biased"" technical change may eventually cause ""neutral"" advance to become desired even in the absence of relative factor price change. Examination of the firm's decision criterion under the assumption that it is a monopsonistic buyer of factors of production, discloses that under identical initial conditions (i.e., relative factor prices and relative costs of alternative forms of technical change) the firm will prefer more ""biased"" technical change relative to the situation in which it purchases factors competitively. In particular, the firm will, under these condition, seek those ""biased"" technical changes which economize on the factor whose elasticity of supply is relatively smaller. Finally, it was also discovered that, contrary to previous suppositions, changes in the elasticity of substitution do affect the optimal capital-labor ration for each factor price combination in all cases but one.",Morton I.

The fact that capital goods are durable and hardly transferable once they have been installed in some factories requires that different vintages of capital goods should be distinguished. The traditional nonvintage input-output systems by Leontief and others are compared with our vintage model; it is seen that they are identical only when capital goods are ""perfectly malleable"" in the sense defined in the text. This is, of course, a very stringent and unrealistic condition. When it does not hold, the replacement coefficients cannot be constant and deviate from Leontief's (constant) flow coefficients. The capital coefficients obey the Sectoral Flexible Acceleration Principle instead of the simple one; it is seen that that level of activity of an industry i at which the acceleration principle ceases to work for a capital good j (because of loss of acceleration) depends on the age composition, as well as the total amount of the stocks of capital good j installed in industry i. It is seen, however, that the equilibrium rate of growth calculated from the traditional model would not be very far from the one calculated from our more general and realistic model; so that from the long run point of view, there is little difference between the two. This means that the vintage and nontransferabilit of capital goods would not be so far reaching in the long run growth analysis as they are in the discussion of cyclical movements.",Michio Morishima and Yasuo Murata,Michio Morishima,Yasuo Murata,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The paper also describes sampling experiments in which the correct solution of a quadratic programming problem subject to linear constraints was compared with the solution of a linear programming problem obtained by replacing the quadratic maximand by its tangent hyperplane at the initial point and by other linear approximations.

Next it proves that Hannan's method in his latter article is asymptotically equal to maximum likelihood estimation of the distributed lag model. Hannan's method is useful when the investigator's a priori knowledge about the stochastic process of the residual is minimal. But if the process can be specified to be, say, a first order or second order autoregressive system, it is desirable to use such knowledge in estimation. For such a case, the paper proposes an estimator of the distributed lag model based on the Gauss-Newton iterative method and proves it to be asymptotically equal to the maximum likelihood estimator.

The problem is viewed as a generalized type of nonlinear programming problem. Mathematically, a basic difficulty in such a model is of course its enormous size; and it is desirable to find methods of testing approximate solutions. One such test is provided by the duality theory of nonlinear programming, which is shown to apply to this situation, so that the problem can be regarded as either of two distinct problems, which are shown to have the same optimal solution. Economically, these two problems may be described in terms of determining the optimal procedure at any given time during the period in terms of what has already happened, or alternatively in terms of what is required to happen subsequent to that time.

To overcome this difficulty, assumptions are usually made about the relationships between observed and the unobserved long-run variables. Such assumptions have led to distributed lag analysis. In an earlier paper I have shown that such an approach is likely to give erroneous results, for the adjustment process may not be consistent with the comparative statics solutions for the short-run variables. In the present paper, the earlier analysis is supplemented and it is also shown how the problem can be overcome and how the long-run coefficients can be estimated even though the long-run equilibrium values are unobserved. The basic deviation from other formulations of this subject is that adjustment equations are used to described only those movements of variables about which comparative statics has nothing to say.

Our theory presents a natural hierarchy of coherently decentralized systems which is based on the increasing amounts of information which are to be transmitted to divisional units for proper decentralized decision making. In general, this information involves more than prices alone and the notion of preemptive goals is introduced for this purpose by means of examining dual convex programming problems. Employing our precise specifications, uniqueness of divisional optima (in contrast to certain trivial cases of decentralization) is not required. Thus, additional flexibility is available to divisions without violating company goals. Further we show that our procedure is a robust one in the sense that approximate fulfillment of the preemptive goals, e.g., non-optimal but close to optimal divisional solutions, results in small deviations from optimal profit.","A.

In addition to conventional smoothness and proportionality conditions, in each case an Invariance Axiom is proposed. For technological change this says, in a sense, that when there is no technological change there is no change in the index. One can prove that in each case there is a unique index satisfying the axioms, and this is a Divisia index. Since these continuous indexes are not generally independent of the path, the problem of how often to change index weights may be viewed in the light of a choice between invariance and independence.

The more fundamental one consists in the formulation of a demand function for commodities--such as natural gas--whose consumption is technologically related to the stock of appliances. We believe that in such markets, the behavior of the consumer can be described best in terms of a dynamic mechanism. Related to this is the more specific problem of estimating the parameters of the demand function, when the demand model is cast in dynamic terms and when observations are drawn from a time series of cross sections. Accordingly, this paper is centered around these two major themes, although, as the title suggests, the emphasis is placed on the second one. In Section 1, we present the theoretical formulation of the dynamic model for gas. In Section 2, the results of the estimation of the gas model by ordinary least squares methods are presented. These results, together with more fundamental theoretical considerations, suggest a different approach. The essence of this approach, which is not restricted to the gas model, is discussed in Section 3, while two alternative procedures for estimating the coefficients of the dynamic model in the light of this new approach are proposed in Section 4. It is subsequently shown that the application of these procedures to the gas data produces results that are reasonable on the basis of a priori theoretical considerations.",Pietro Balestra and Marc Nerlove,Pietro Balestra,Marc Nerlove,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The model explains interest rates, the price level, and the quantity of money and bonds in terms of real wealth, real output, the monetary base, and the volume of government bonds and bank portfolios. The quarterly series of investment and output are derived from annual data by what is believed to be a new method of interpolation. The demand and supply functions are assumed to be linear in the first differences of logarithms. The parameters of the four equations are estimated by two-stage least squares. Of the 14 estimates all but one have the theoretically expected sign and all but two are significant at 5 per cent. The interest elasticities of money demand and bond supply are clearly negative, while the interest elasticities of money supply and bond demand, though the former is not significant, are positive. Estimating the same functions separately by ordinary least squares is shown to produce considerably different results; in particular, price and interest elasticities are much smaller in this case. The simultaneous estimates imply that price changes were mainly determined by investment activity and by changes in the monetary base, both with the expected positive sign. Interest rates, on the other hand, are positively affected by investment, output, and the supply of bonds by the government and the banking system, while the monetary base has a negative effect. The quantity of money is mainly, but not exclusively, determined by the monetary base. The volume of bonds, finally, is dominated by investment.",Jürg Niehans and Heidi Schelbert-Syfrig,Jürg Niehans,Heidi Schelbert-Syfrig,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

This assumption is relaxed in stochastic linear programming where some or all of the parameters are known only by their probability distributions. A distinction is generally drawn between the two approaches to stochastic linear programming: the passive (also termed ""wait and see"" approach) and the active (also termed ""here and now"" approach). In the passive approach the probability distribution of the objective function is derived explicitly or by numerical approximations, and decision rules are based on some features of this distribution. In the active approach additional decision variables are introduced indicating the amounts of various resources to be allocated to different activities. This paper analyzes a method of characterizing the distribution of the objective function values corresponding to the set of extreme points in the solution space for both these approaches of stochastic linear programming. Truncation refers to the selection of extreme points that are neighbors, so to say, to the optimal extreme point. The sensitivity of objective function values corresponding to truncated solutions is analyzed here in terms of stability properties, stability being measured in terms of variance. An application to an empirical economic problem where there are parametric variations in the coefficient matrix only is presented to illustrate the numerical problems and approximations involved in estimating the statistical distribution of the objective function. From an economic point of view the approach outlined here offers a theory of the second best, since it specifies the set of conditions under which a value of the objective function that corresponds to the optimum solution on the average may have higher instability than another value of the objective function that corresponds to a truncated solution, under the assumed conditions of stochastic linear programming.",J.

Keynesian difficulties, associated with divergence between warranted and natural rates of growth, arise when capital intensity is limited by the unwillingness of investors to acquire capital at unattractively low rates of return. But why should the community wish to save when rates of return are too unattractive to invest? This can be rationalized only if there are stores of value other than capital, with whose rates of retrun the marginal productivity of capital must compete. The paper considers monetary debt of the government as one alternative store of value and shows how enough saving may be channeled into this form to bring the warranted rate of growth of capital down to the natural rate. Equilibrium capital intensity and interest rates are then determined by portfolio behavior and monetary factors as well as by saving behavior and technology.

It is a decomposition forecast because, as is well known in input-output analysis, input coefficients by industries add up t unity. Attention is paid to the predictive achievements of subgroups of input coefficients. The information measures defined are applied to ten input-output tables for the Netherlands, 1948-1957.",C. B.

It is proved that there is a unique equilibrium point for every strictly concave game. A dynamic model for nonequilibrium situations is proposed. This model consists of a system of differential equations which specify the rate of change of each player's strategy. It is shown that for a strictly concave game the system is globally asymptotically stable with respect to the unique equilibrium point of the game.

In demand analysis it is therefore essential to specify the period of adjustment; there is no such thing as ""the"" elasticity of demand. Elasticities derived from time series for separate countries differ significantly from each other and from those derived from combined time series, but this does not invalidate the combined analysis because the estimates for separate countries are often unacceptable.",H.

The inverse of the price system has diagonal elements dominating single off-diagonal elements in both the same row and the same column, while the inverse of the income system has diagonal elements which are necessarily dominant only over single elements in the same column.

This overall central information (OCI) problem may be decomposed into subproblems that can be solved by mutually independent ""sectors,"" coordinated by the ""centre"" through having the latter allocate the resources to the various sectors. The original OCI problem is then transformed into a two-level problem, in which the ""central problem"" is to evolve an allocation pattern where the sum of the maximal yields of the ""sector problems"" will be the greatest. The solution of the two-level problem is achieved by setting up a game-theoretical model. The players are on the one hand the centre, on the other the team of sectors. The strategies of the centre are the feasible allocation patterns, those of the sectors are the high feasible shadow price systems in the duals of the sector problems. The payoff function is the sum of the dual sector objective functions. It is shown that if certain regularity conditions are satisfied, then the value of the polyhedral game which has thus been defined is the maximal yield of the OCI problem. In place of a direct solution of the polyhedral game, a fictitious play of the game is undertaken. The first part of the paper discusses a general model, within whose scope the symbols and definitions are presented and the mathematical theorems are proved.

However, such neglect of the role of the commercial banking system in determining the money supply introduces simultaneous equations bias. In this paper, an aggregate money-supply function is derived in which an attempt is made to segregate the exogenous and endogenous aspects of the money stock. The coefficients of a structural model of the monetary sector which includes this supply relationship, an interest-responsive transactions demand function, and a reduced form income equation are estimated jointly for both the postwar and interwar periods. Structural supply and demand elasticities are computed, and it is shown that comparable single-equation elasticities are biased downward.",Ronald L. Teigen,Ronald L.

https://www.jstor.org/stable/1913037,Spectral Analysis of Seasonal Adjustment Procedures,"Vol. 32, No. 3, Jul., 1964",Vol. 32,No. 3,Jul.,1964,"This paper discusses one of the uses to which two powerful techniques of modern time series analysis may be put in economics: namely, the study of the precise effects of seasonal adjustment procedures on the characteristics of the series to which they are applied. Since most economic data appearing at intervals of less than a year are to a greater or lesser extent ""manufactured"" from more basic time series, the problem of assessing the effects of the ""manufacturing"" processes upon the essential characteristics of the raw material to which they are applied is not unimportant. Perhaps the most common type of adjustment applied to raw economic time series is that designed to eliminate so-called seasonal fluctuations. The precise nature of seasonality is not easy to define, but an attempt is made in Section 2.1 below. The techniques employed to study the effects of seasonal adjustment procedures are those of spectral and cross-spectral analysis. In somewhat oversimplified terms the basic idea behind these types of analysis is that a stochastic time series may be decomposed into an infinite number of sine and cosine waves with infinitesimal random amplitudes. Spectral analysis deals with a single time series in terms of its frequency ""content"": cross-spectral analysis deals with the relation between two time series in terms of their respective frequency ""contents."" The two techniques are discussed in both theoretical and practical terms. Spectral analyses have been made for about seventy-five time series of United States employment, unemployment, labor force, and various categories thereof. Cross-spectral analyses have been made of the relations between these series and the corresponding series as seasonally adjustment by the procedures used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Two major conclusions regarding the effects of the BLS seasonal adjustment procedures emerge from these emerge from these analyses. First, these procedures remove far more from the series to which they are applied than can properly be considered as seasonal. Second, if the relation between two seasonally adjusted series in time is compared with the corresponding relation between the original series in time, it is found that there is a distortion due to the process of seasonal adjustment itself. Both defects impair the usefulness of the seasonally adjusted series as indicators of economic conditions, but, of the two, temporal distortion is the more serious defect. Examples of some of these results are discussed below in Section 3.3.",Marc Nerlove,Marc Nerlove,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

This is that the utility function can be assumed to be homogeneous in the value of consumption at different dates. For this to be true for all possible sets of prices for the different commodities it would be necessary for the utility function to be completely homogeneous in the quantities of all the goods consumed. And, if this were true, then a change in the level of income would produce proportionate changes in the consumption of all commodities. This is so contrary to common sense and the results of empirical research that the assumption of complete homogeneity must be dismissed. It follows that Friedman's basic assumption of the homogeneity of the utility function considered as a function of the total value of consumption at different periods could only hold true for certain special sets of prices.

In (2) it is assumed that the true residuals are normally distributed, and in both cases it is assumed that the independent variables are fixed variates, and that the variance-covariance matrix of the dependent variable is known in any sample up to multiplication by an unknown scalar. The formulas for the estimators and test statistics are given in terms of the original variables, and a simple proof is provided of the unbiasedness of the F test. Extensive use is made of the properties of idempotent matrices, and geometric interpretations of the results are briefly described.",John S. Chipman and M. M. Rao,John S. Chipman,M. M.

This latter assumption probably is the most unrealistic one, but could be modified somewhat without affecting some of our conclusions. We have shown that, given these assumptions, the ratio of the quantity of security j to that of security j is the same for all individuals independently of their wealth and the parameters of their utility functions (providing that some of each security is held by every individual). The ratios of money holdings to wealth will differ among individuals, however. We also have shown that the elasticities of aggregate demand depend only upon the expected ""yields"" and the variances and covariances of the probability distributions of future prices. These demand relations were used in analyzing a problem in debt management, namely, ""how can the composition of the government debt be altered in a way such as to hold gross national product a constant?"" The answer to this question together with that to ""how can the composition of the debt be altered in a way such as to keep the total current value of government debt a constant"" leads us to conclude that--given our assumptions--variations in interest costs probably are so small that they can be neglected.",O.

A supply curve is fitted to the raisin industry and used to evaluate the importance of various factors: weather is of overwhelming importance. Subsequent analysis focuses on the most vulnerable aspect of raisin production: its dependence on early forecasts of rain in September and October when the grapes are being dried and in danger of being damaged by rain. Section 1, in the tradition of micro-economic, partial equilibrium analysis, is concerned with the value of weather information to a single grower. Only the grower focused upon is assumed to receive the better information. This assumption implies there is high value for forecasting rain three weeks in advance. A figure of 90.95 per acre is the value of perfect three week forecasts. Were this value to be realized for each bearing acre in 1960, the total value of better weather information to the raisin industry would be 20,300,000. But merely summing across firms to get industry totals may lead to a fallacy of composition: the analysis must be extended to a wider partial equilibrium framework. Section 2 examines the value of better weather information to the raisin industry as a whole. Since costs are not greatly affected by improved weather information, profit differences are closely approximated by changes in revenue. The elasticity of demand for raisins is calculated from a demand curve fitted to industry data. The inelasticity of demand causes profit to fall under the impact of better information, at least in the short run. The scope of the analysis is then extended to other industries. Using this wider viewpoint, the Conclusion examines the possibility of a simple tax that would reallocate land and labor. The presence of released resources seems to imply a clear gain for better information. However, the basis of such a gain is positive value for these resources in other uses. But the short run inelasticity of other possible products makes it clear that, at least in the short run, better weather information results in net loss. However, some relief is offered through the possibility of regulation. An Appendix examines the question of the value of inaccurate forecasts.",Lester B. Lave,Lester B.

If the market shall reach a Pareto optimal state, there must be negotiations between the participants, and it seems that the problem can best be analysed as an n-person cooperative game.

It is demonstrated that stability depends upon a multitude of parameters, some of which are suppressed in aggregative model construction. The economy is necessarily unstable when perfect, if myopic expectations are assumed. With naive expectations stability becomes a definite possibility, particularly if firms attempt only a delayed adjustment of inventories to the equilibrium level. Although the empirical evidence marshaled in order to illustrate the application of the theorems does not prove sufficiently accurate to permit precise conclusions, it is apparent that the conditions for stability may well be satisfied for reasonable values of the system's parameters.

The total change in output in each sector is expressed by means of an interindustry model as a function of four factors: (i) the change in the composition of domestic demand; (ii) the change in the volume of exports; (iii) the change in the volume of imports; and (iv) changes in technology and organization. The model is then applied to explain the process of industrialization in Japan from 1914 to 1954, during which period its economy was transformed from that of a typical underdeveloped country to that of an advanced society. The results show that less than a quarter of the increase in the share of industry in total output is due to increases in exports and changes in domestic demand, while more than three quarters is traceable to changes in supply conditions, including substitution of domestic manufactures for both imported manufactures and primary products. Changes in technology and in labor productivity are also examined briefly.","Hollis B. Chenery, Shuntaro Shishido and Tsunehiko Watanabe",Hollis B.

It is shown that the number of parameters to be estimated in a complete set of demand equations can be drastically reduced by grouping in accordance with want relationships. By following the initial grouping with further groupings of successively higher orders, all parameters may be estimated from as few as two sets of observations of price and quantity changes.

It is shown that, so far as consistency is concerned, good approximations give good results, but that different estimators have different sensitivities to specification errors of the types considered. It follows that the choice of an estimator may depend crucially on its properties in such situations. The problem leads naturally to a consideration of the positions of T. C. Liu and H. Wold on the prevalence of underidentification and recursiveness, respectively. The concept of recursiveness is generalized as is the Proximity Theorem, and it is shown that a position intermediate between the two just mentioned is highly tenable, such a position permitting the use of simultaneous equation estimators.

This model makes it possible to estimate the impact of alternative time patterns of decline of fixed investment and government purchases on the quarterly national income accounts, particularly on GNP. The model is also used to discover the implications of new potential policies, particularly improvements in the automatic stabilizers. A simulation approach is employed to study the effects of the error terms in the equations, both to see the forecasting potential of a model of this sort and to test whether errors lead to cumulative deviations from the expected path of the system.","James S.

Total money holdings and idle balances are treated as alternative variables. In Part I an aggregative liquidity function is analyzed twice, once using interest rates and wealth as independent variables and once using last year's idle balances as a third independent variable. Very good fits were obtained in both cases. In Part II the liquidity function is disaggregated by major holders. Only one independent variable, the rate of interest, is used. Most emphasis is on year-to-year changes. Estimates obtained in this way are compared to those of a naive model. Finally the elasticity of the liquidity functions at various levels of interest rates is analyzed. Neither the data nor theoretical considerations give any reason for expecting a liquidity trap.",Martin Bronfenbrenner and Thomas Mayer,Martin Bronfenbrenner,Thomas Mayer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

Practically all the econometric models estimated by the simultaneous equation approach are overidentified, the contention being that economic theory or a priori information would require the exclusion of a sufficient number of variables from a given relationship so that it becomes overidentified. It is argued in this paper that the contrary is true and that economic theory would require the inclusion of many more variables than those found in the existing econometric models so that the structural relationships included in these models are likely to be underidentified. Apparently ""reasonable"" overidentified structures have been obtained probably only because the specification errors arising from omission of relevant variables have cancelled one another.

While the gains to be realized from the use of more powerful statistical methods are quite modest, they are, nonetheless, real and should not be neglected. On the other hand, coefficient-by-coefficient comparisons of structural estimates by the two approaches are not suitable in many situations. There is need for comparisons of summary statistics of a whole system. In particular, reduced form coefficients may show large differences even though component structural coefficients appear to be close. In addition, the efficiency properties of single equation least squares estimates do not hold under transformation from structural to reduced form coefficients.

It is also found that the usual asymptotic standard errors of two-stage least squares give a rather satisfactory picture of the variability of the estimates about the true value.

On the customary assumptions, a causal chain system is designed so that its relations both in the original form and in the reduced form can be specified in terms of conditional expectations, whereas the relations of interdependent systems allow such specification only in the reduced form. A third type of model is discussed, called conditional causal chains, which formally is similar to interdependent systems, with the important difference that the behavioural relations of the original system are specified in terms of conditional expectations.",H.

Two extreme models are specified, depending on the nature of the disturbances in the relations. In one model, simultaneous equation bias does not occur; in the other model, it does occur. Asymptotic ""least squares"" estimates (estimates that would be obtained given an infinite sample) are presented for the latter case. In this case, (1) corrections for the bias of least squares estimates are derived for some specifications, (2) it is shown that there exists a fairly pronounced tendency for the least squares estimated elasticity sum to approach one, regardless of the true value of the elasticities.",Irving Hoch,Irving Hoch,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

The lag in the development of adaptable hybrids for particular areas and the lag in the entry of seed producers into these areas (differences in origins) are explained on the basis of varying profitability of entry, ""profitability"" being a function of market density, and innovation and marketing cost. Differences in the long-run equilibrium use of hybrid corn (ceilings) and in the rates of approach to that equilibrium (slopes) are explained, at least in part, by differences in the profitability of the shift from open pollinated to hybrid varieties in different parts of the country.

It is found that in certain circumstances the least squares method of estimation when applied directly to these models gives rise to a large bias and underestimation of the random variation. Furthermore, the results differ the more from those obtained by maximum likelihood estimation the larger the degree of interdependence and the larger the relative importance of the residual variation in the models.

This hypothesis implies certain empirically meaningful and interesting conditions on the price coefficients of the demand functions. These conditions are, however, not subjected here to statistical test. A price index formula is next developed for measuring branch prices (e.g., the price of food, the price of clothing) and with the use of these indices a rationale is found for the individual doing his budgeting by first deciding how to allocate expenditure among the several branches and then making independent decisions as to how best to spend each branch allocation on the commodities within the branch. That this budgeting practice is both familiar and consistent with the proposed hypothesis is taken as evidence in support of the hypothesis and, therefore, of the implications for the price coefficients in demand functions.",Robert H.

The first problem, in which cost of transportation between plants is ignored, is found to be a linear programming problem, with which is associated a system of rents that sustains an optimal assignment. The recognition of cost of interplant transportation in the second problem introduces complications which call for more laborious and largely unexplored computations and which also appear to defeat the price system as a means of sustaining an optimal assignment.",Tjalling C.

This method, however, employs only one of a class of transformation matrices, A, which yield this result; namely, the special case where A = (Z′Z)-1Z′. As is well known, the consistency of the estimators, α̂, requires that all of the variables whose sample values are represented as elements of the matrix Z be asymptotically uncorrelated with the error terms, e. In recent years some rather elaborate methods of obtaining consistent and otherwise optimal estimators of the coefficients α have been developed. In this paper we present a straightforward generalization of classical linear estimation which leads to estimates of α which possess optimal properties equivalent to those of existing limited-information single-equation estimators, and which is pedagogically simpler and less expensive to apply.3",R.

I. The elements of the development problem and the data available are considered from the point of view of selecting the most significant structural relationships for a formal model. II. A nonlinear programming model is presented which is designed particularly to analyze the choice between self-sufficiency and international specialization and the resulting investment patterns under various types of restrictions. III. A method of solving the programming problem by a simple iterative procedure is suggested. It takes advantage of the structure of the matrix of activities and the limited number of primary factors involved. Convergence of the solution is demonstrated. IV. A development model for Southern Italy is constructed for purposes of illustration, based on studies of consumption, investment, and input structure and assumptions as to the remaining parameters. A solution for a hypothetical development program is given, showing the method of solution and the effect of variation in several of the parameters. V.

The proposed theory analyzes consumer behavior from two related aspects, the first being that concerned with the consumer's subjective point of view as to his actions in the market, and the second being concerned with the economist's point of view as an objective observer of the consumer's market behavior. The paper deals with the n-commodity case, and makes no restrictive assumptions as to the regularity of the commodity space, existence of a utility function, continuity of consumption, or non-satiation in taste. In addition to the usual postulates for static analysis, only two behavioral axioms are assumed: (a) a revealed preference transitivity type axiom, and (b) a ""no-price illusion"" axiom (somewhat similar to the usual ""no-money illusion"" assumption). Demand theorems analogous to those commonly derived in consumer theory are proved by means of a generalized revealed preference approach and by the use of convex set theory in Euclidean n-space.",Harvey M.

The objections can be removed by introducing further time measures--the variances of the input and output distributions over time, and the higher statistical moments. In the exact, general case the relations between the sets of moments, the rate of return, the real wage rate, and a suitably defined production function determine output, input, and the value of capital.

This assumption seems highly unrealistic, and it is dropped in this paper and replaced by the assumption that each player has a perception of the payoff function of each of the other players; these perceptions may be incorrect. It is shown that this leads to an analogue of characteristic function theory in which each player has a subjective characteristic function which he believes represents the strength of the several coalitions. It is proposed that the coalitions be treated directly as outcomes and that individual preferences among them be ascertained. If the von Neumann utility axioms plus one other are met, then it can be argued that a simple transformation of the resulting utility function is a player's subjective characteristic function. The beginnings of an equilibrium theory are outlined for this more general model; this theory reduces to a known one when there are no misperceptions.

This class is shown to be substantially equivalent to a utility theory in which there are just noticeable difference functions which state for any value of utility the change in utility so that the change is just noticeable.

The objective of this paper is to present a theory of consumer demand with variable preferences. The assumption that the individual consumer has a unique ordinal utility index function is replaced by the assumption that he has a family of ordinal utility functions; advertising expenditures by the sellers of commodities are assumed to determine which one of these ordinal utility functions is to be maximized. From these assumptions are derived a number of theoretical relations which measurements defining advertising elasticities of demand must satisfy. The relations involving shifts in demand and advertising elasticities of demand are shown to be analogues of the theorems of consumer demand under fixed preferences. For example, a theorem corresponding to the well-known Leontief-Hicks theorem on aggregate commodities has been worked out, thus showing that, under certain advertising conditions, a group to commodities may be treated as a single good.",R.

So far as regression coefficients are concerned, it is shown what conditions must be fulfilled to obtain best linear unbiased least squares estimates when the data are in ratio form. These conditions will be more frequently fulfilled with cross-section than with time series data.

The model has two features (a) the ""general Leontief aspect"" which assumes that there is one and only one output for each activity, and (b) a ""dynamic (or one-way flow) aspect"" which assumes that no inputs for an activity occur later in time than the time of its output. In the optimal solution certain activities appear in positive amounts and others in zero quantities. Once they are known, the quantitative solution is obtained readily by direct solution of the equations. Hence, the basic problem is to select the activities which appear in positive quantity in the optimal solution. The main results are (a) the ""Samuelson Property"" due to the Leontief aspect; i.e., the selection of these activities can be made independent of the bill of goods; (b) the local optimization property due to the inclusion also of the dynamic aspect; i.e., when the activities are ordered over time according to the time of production of their principal item, the selection of activities for the first k time periods, k = 1, 2,... can be made without consideration of the nature of activities producing in time periods later than k, moreover, if the coefficients in the linear objective function are interpreted as ""costs"" to perform a unit quantity of an activity, then the optimum selection for successive time periods can be obtained inductively as a sequence of local optimizations using an implicit cost for each time period by subtracting from original costs those implicit costs associated with earlier time periods. The two properties, together, lead to a special computational procedure which is more efficient than the ordinary procedure of the generalized simplex method and which, of course, is not applicable to a general linear programming problem. Numerically, the number of multiplications, required for the optimal solution by the conventional simplex method, is reduced by a factor p where p is the number of discrete time periods considered.",George B.

A somewhat different approach to the problem of optimizing business costs is therefore essayed in this article. The objective is to develop a means whereby general qualitative properties of economic theorems on cost behavior may be used to provide quantitative answers as a guide to business conduct. It is assumed that total costs are unknown but have the general form theoretically ascribed to total cost functions when output occurs beyond the inflection point (or point of minimum marginal cost) on the total cost function. Certain easily ascertained variables (direct manhours) are then used as surrogates in place of the unknown total costs in order to determine optimal production patterns over a finite time horizon, in which sales are assumed to be known or given. The model includes multi-product and factor considerations but not inventory carrying costs, liquidity considerations, etc. In short, it is a production model intended for application to production problems.","A.

Alternatively, this period can be defined as the difference between an output period and an input period, each with respect to the plans of a marginal entrepreneur about to start a new firm. The output period is the weighted mean of times to future sales; similarly, the input period is the weighted mean of times to future purchases. The value of the period of production is considered here for certain simple cases where it can be simply related to the average periods of the capital goods being used. These results provide approximations for more realistic cases where the average period of a capital good is less easily defined. Subsequently we examine the variations in this period of production when the rate of interest changes. If the results are applied to an economy in which each firm produces only one commodity, the complete period of production can then be defined for each commodity, and this determines the effect of changes in the rate of interest on the ratio of the price of this commodity to an index of prices of the primary factors of production, labour and land. Finally, some rough calculations are made to estimate the order of magnitudes of actual complete periods of production.",J. D. Sargan,J. D. Sargan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

A general solution to this problem is exhibited under certain ""reasonable"" assumptions concerning the nature of production and storage costs, and a convenient graphical method of securing the solution is outlined. One significant aspect of the solution is that under certain conditions (and especially if the cost of carrying inventories is ""large"" relative to the marginal cost of production), the optimal plan consists of a sequence of plans covering successive intervals of the entire horizon and having the following property: the production schedule for each interval is identical with the optimum plan for the corresponding interval considered separately; it depends, in other words, on requirements within the interval itself, but is essentially independent of requirements for earlier or later periods. It is shown that these results have significant implications concerning the length of the expectation and planning horizon relevant to current production decisions and that they throw some light on the rationale of certain observed business practices.",Franco Modigliani and Franz E.

The dynamic stability conditions for an n-counutry model have been derived in mathematical terms through a system of difference equations under quite general conditions in the Appendix. Special pain has been taken in the text to interpret these mathematical conditions in economic terms for a more restricted three-country model. Three cases of exchange rate adjustments have been analyzed. It has been found that, provided that each country taken by itself is stable (i.e., that a depreciation of its currency will improve its balance of payments, all other countries' par values remaining unchanged), a sufficient condition for the stability of a three-country system is that, for any pair of countries, the absolute value of the product of the effects on each others' balances, each acting alone, is smaller than the product of the effects on their own balances.",J.

The equation system forecasts a vector of endogenous variables which are essentially random variables with probability distributions. Hence a vector of standard errors is desirable. Formulas for estimating the elements of this vector are worked out in matrix form convenient for computation. The problem of presenting the forecast as a vector of distributions is discussed in terms of confidence intervals and tolerance intervals.

The model, though hypothetical, is constructed in terms of relevance to characteristic multi-product and process operations, such as those found in the oil industry. All important phases, production, manufacturing (refining), transportation and marketing, are covered. Through tax considerations, financial as well as the more usual price, cost, and technological conditions, are included. The dual theorem of linear programming is used in a manner which makes it relevant to sensitivity analysis involved in studying technological and structural changes. This suggests possible uses of the dual theorem to areas other than transportation and classical decentralization analysis which have, to date, received major attention in the programming literature. By means of the dual formulation and specified computational procedures detailed in this paper considerable simplification in sensitivity analysis is achieved. A general theorem is established (easily applied in this and similar cases) by means of which an optimal solution to the dual is obtained without the need for matrix inversion or calculating an optimal simplex tableau. Finally, the solution and analysis are carried out with respect to a ""kinked"" functional which is only piecewise linear. A prototype is thus provided for handling a certain class of nonlinear programming problems which are also relevant to important areas of economic analysis.","A. Charnes, W. W. Cooper and B.

To illustrate this approach most clearly, free of extraneous analytic details, we consider a simple but nontrivial multi-stage investment problem. We show how exact solutions may be obtained in some cases, approximate solutions in others, and how these approximate solutions may be used to obtain more accurate solutions in the general case. Of particular importance is the decrease in the number of independent variables made possible by this approach. This is not only important from the theoretical standpoint, but is also of great value in reducing the cost in time and effort of numerical computation.",Richard Bellman,Richard Bellman,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

This study was written and submitted to ECONOMETRICA before Professor Morgenstern sent the Council of the Econometric Society his recent suggestions regarding the conditions that ought to be required for election to the Fellows of the Society and in which he emphasized the danger in economics of a purely abstract orientation. The present study is concerned with this same problem. As one of the most eminent members of the Econometric Society wrote me regarding this study: ""The only thing that troubles me is that most of this is so crystal clear, so self-evident that it nearly seems superfluous to bring it to the attention of the readers. However, when I think of the Kind of arguments and the kind of thinking that is currently going on, I realize that what appears self-evident to us does not have the same character for others.""",M.

Increased dispersion of the timing of consumption responses has the same effect; thus a lengthening of the average lag combined with a concentration of the lag pattern may have a combined result going either way. Of course, any approximately realistic shift in the consumption lag distribution, such as might result from a change in the amount of terms of instalment credit, would not be of the simple type treated here.

A simple example is then employed to demonstrate that it is quite possible to set up a consistent classical system in which relative prices are determined in the real sector independently of absolute prices in the monetary sector. Next the details of Patinkin's analysis are examined for the flaws that led him to believe that such a system could not be set up.
