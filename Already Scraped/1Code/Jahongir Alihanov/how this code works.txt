my script will do the following step by step!

1. Loops in the given year https://academic.oup.com/qje/issue-archive/ + <given year>
2. then scrapes every issue links in that year!
3. And then goes to the every issue link and gets every Article link which has an abstract!
4 again loops in stored detailed links and gets the every information of it!

that's it!
