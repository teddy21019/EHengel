2010-2015 Exactly matched (251)

2000-2009 Exactly matched (413)

1990-1999 Too many (465). But if I drop papers without abstracts (56), then exactly matched. (409)

1980-1989 Too many (557) If I drop papers without abstracts (164), then 393, which is too few.

This is now a great outcome.

Now I am manually checking the period 1980-1989
